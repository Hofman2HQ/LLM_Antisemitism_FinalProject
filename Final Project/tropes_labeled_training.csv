Cultural Marxism,2022-11-05,9:12:38,unavailable,Telegram,https://t.me/DeportationMassTM/35151,"The point of this post was very simple: People should not blame the old order for the actions of those who overthrew it. As usual, the ""Third Positionists"" totally missed the point. These self-identified Socialists have spent the last few years claiming (without any empirical evidence) that Cultural Marxism does not exist and that we instead live under ""Cultural (Classical) Liberalism"" or ""Cultural Capitalism."" ""Leftists and non-Whites are not demolishing the West and peddling Globalism, it's those dang Anglo-American Liberal Free Market Capitalists!"" Before WW2 (or at least until around the Great Depression, when Socialists gained more influence), the ideology of the Anglosphere was unabashed White (Anglo-Saxon) supremacism, eugenics, scientific racism, segregation, anti-immigration and nativism, Christianity, strong families, and traditional culture. You'd have to be completely insane to believe that the system we live under today is remotely comparable in terms of economics or ideology. We have more regulations than ever before, big government-backed monopolies, private-public partnerships, bloated welfare states, massive taxes, massive global wealth redistribution from Whites to non-Whites, and Socialist (or ""Social Democratic"") parties dominating governments since the end of WW2. Even the so-called ""Capitalist"" elites of the WEF & Co. express their desire to abolish Capitalism. Furthermore, all of the theory that underpins so-called ""Cultural Liberalism"" was cooked up by Marxist academics and their students, not the corporate boardrooms of Fortune 500 companies. Noel Ignatiev, Franz Boas, Theo Adorno, Herbert Marcuse, Kim Crenshaw, Angela Davis, etc. are Socialist Third Worldists, not Classical Liberals. Plus, as I've repeatedly pointed out, postwar Globalist ideology has deep roots in the Socialist movement, dating back to the earliest Utopians and Radicals (I'll write an article on this topic soon). Modern ""Capitalists"" (corporations, businesses, etc.) parrot Cultural Marxist (""Woke"") ideals for a few reasons: 1. They're forced to do so by Civil Rights laws (enacted by Socialists & Social Democrat governments in the 60s/70s). 2. They're threatened by ""cancel culture"" enforced by Leftist media hegemony and NGOs like the ADL. 3. Leftist activists aggressively colonized corporations as part of their Long March Through The Institutions of Power. 4. Globalist elites (who take ideological cues from Leftist academia and from being predominantly ethnically Jewish) have bought up and monopolized corporations. 5. Too Big to Fail companies can push unprofitable ideological nonsense because they're supported by the state. 6. Companies are kept in line by private finance pressure, e.g. BlackRock's ESG which is a corporate Cultural Marxist social credit score. Corporations aren't special unique entities controlled by magical abstract economic wizardry, but nodes of power (like government, media, academia, or judiciary) that can be captured or dominated by ideologically-motivated parties and individuals. Finally, if Anglo-Saxon Classical Liberalism inevitably leads to Globalism and transgender toddlers due to some inherent ""structural flaw,"" then what does that imply for imperial monarchist countries, like Germany, Russia, and China? They succumbed to Leftism faster than any Anglo-Saxon state. Spain was a Fascist/monarchist country up until the late 70s but is now as Globalist as they come. Socialist ""Third Positionists"" want you to blame ""Anglo-American Liberal Capitalists"" for all of our woes because, in typical Leftist fashion, they are trying to sell a poison (Socialist Third Worldism) as its own antidote. They want the technocracy, the UBI, the bloated welfare state, to save all of the ""oppressed"" brown people around the world, and so on. This is why they downplayed or defended the COVID tyranny, claimed that Agenda 21 is irrelevant, tried to rehabilitate Socialist states (e.g. Yugoslavia), and idolize countries like Russia and China, both of which are anti-White, multiethnic/racial technocracies.",point post simple people blame old order actions overthrew usual third positionists totally missed point selfidentified socialists spent last years claiming without empirical evidence cultural marxism exist instead live cultural classical liberalism cultural capitalism leftists nonwhites demolishing west peddling globalism dang angloamerican liberal free market capitalists ww least around great depression socialists gained influence ideology anglosphere unabashed white anglosaxon supremacism eugenics scientific racism segregation antiimmigration nativism christianity strong families traditional culture youd completely insane believe system live today remotely comparable terms economics ideology regulations ever big governmentbacked monopolies privatepublic partnerships bloated welfare states massive taxes massive global wealth redistribution whites nonwhites socialist social democratic parties dominating governments since end ww even socalled capitalist elites wef co express desire abolish capitalism furthermore theory underpins socalled cultural liberalism cooked marxist academics students corporate boardrooms fortune companies noel ignatiev franz boas theo adorno herbert marcuse kim crenshaw angela davis etc socialist third worldists classical liberals plus ive repeatedly pointed postwar globalist ideology deep roots socialist movement dating back earliest utopians radicals ill write article topic soon modern capitalists corporations businesses etc parrot cultural marxist woke ideals reasons theyre forced civil rights laws enacted socialists social democrat governments ss theyre threatened cancel culture enforced leftist media hegemony ngos like adl leftist activists aggressively colonized corporations part long march institutions power globalist elites take ideological cues leftist academia predominantly ethnically jewish bought monopolized corporations big fail companies push unprofitable ideological nonsense theyre supported state companies kept line private finance pressure eg blackrocks esg corporate cultural marxist social credit score corporations arent special unique entities controlled magical abstract economic wizardry nodes power like government media academia judiciary captured dominated ideologicallymotivated parties individuals finally anglosaxon classical liberalism inevitably leads globalism transgender toddlers due inherent structural flaw imply imperial monarchist countries like germany russia china succumbed leftism faster anglosaxon state spain fascistmonarchist country late globalist come socialist third positionists want blame angloamerican liberal capitalists woes typical leftist fashion trying sell poison socialist third worldism antidote want technocracy ubi bloated welfare state save oppressed brown people around world downplayed defended covid tyranny claimed agenda irrelevant tried rehabilitate socialist states eg yugoslavia idolize countries like russia china antiwhite multiethnicracial technocracies,2,0,1,5,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Cultural Marxism,2022-02-09,4:24:17,ettajamesfan,Minds,,"Your celebration is a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages. -Frederick Douglass, 1850 Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past. The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living. -Karl Marx, 1852 Rancid Optimism In announcing his retirement from the absurdly powerful U.S. Supreme Court during a press event at the White House, the gabby octogenarian Stephen Breyer recently held up his pocket copy of the U.S. Constitution and waxed sentimental on the greatness of the nation he loves. Breyer said that the USA was a great democratic ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù ‚Äì ‚Äúan experiment‚Äù that is ‚Äústill going on‚Ä¶My grandchildren and their children, they‚Äôll determine whether the experiment still works. And of course, I am an optimist, and I‚Äôm pretty sure it will,‚Äù Breyer said. ‚ÄúRevolting Barbarity and Shameless Hypocrisy‚Äù The United States was an ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù alright ‚Äì an experiment in racist savagery and class rule. I wonder if Breyer has ever read The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, a harrowing account of life under Black chattel slavery written more than half a century after the ratification of Breyer‚Äôs holy constitution. I wonder if he‚Äôs ever read Douglass‚Äôs brilliant 1850 speech ‚ÄúWhat to the Slave is the Meaning of the Fourth of July?‚Äù ‚Äì the address in which Douglass observed that: to the American slave, ‚Ä¶your Fourth of July‚Ä¶[is] a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelly to which he is the constant victim. To him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciations of tyrants, brass fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade, and solemnity, are, to him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy‚Äîa thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages. There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices, more shocking and bloody, than are the people of these United States, at this very hour. Go where you may, search where you will, roam through all the monarchies and despotisms of the old world, travel through South America, search out every abuse, and when you have found the last, lay your facts by the side of the everyday practices of this nation, and you will say with me, that, for revolting barbarity and shameless hypocrisy, America reigns without a rival. The Man of Business on the Mountain: ‚ÄúSilent Profits‚Äù and ‚Äúthe Quintessential American Story‚Äù In retirement Breyer might also want to read up on the author of the July 4th 1776 Declaration of Independence (DOI), Thomas Jefferson, who was anti-slavery in his youth but went on to prevaricate about the slave system that paid his debts. One of many wealthy white widowers who used young female slaves for sexual release before and after the American ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù (which was fought partly to ensure the survival and expansion of North American Black chattel slavery), Jefferson enjoyed prominence as a ‚Äúrevolutionary leader‚Äù while keeping some of his own children as slaves. Justice Breyer can start with Henry Wiencek‚Äôs heralded volume, Master of the Mountain: Thomas Jefferson and His Slaves (2012), which dug into previously overlooked evidence in Jefferson‚Äôs papers and new archaeological work at Jefferson‚Äôs Monticello site to paint a depressing picture of Jefferson‚Äôs stunted, penny-pinching world. As one reviewer notes: ‚ÄòWiencek‚Äôs eloquent, persuasive book based [shows that] ‚Ä¶ We must‚Ä¶ follow the money‚Ä¶ Wiencek‚Äôs Jefferson is a man of business and public affairs who makes a success of his debt-ridden plantation thanks to what he calls the ‚Äúsilent profits‚Äù gained from his slaves and thanks to a skewed moral universe that he and thousands of others readily inhabited. We see Jefferson taking out a slave-equity line of credit with a Dutch bank to finance the building of Monticello and deftly creating smoke screens when visitors are dismayed by his apparent endorsement of a system they thought he‚Äôd vowed to overturn. It is not a pretty story. Slave boys are whipped to make them work in the nail factory at Monticello that pays Jefferson‚Äôs grocery bills. Parents are divided from children in his ledgers‚Ä¶ Slaves are bought, sold, given as gifts, and used as collateral for the loan that pays for Monticello‚Äôs construction‚Äïwhile Jefferson composes theories that obscure the dynamics of what he himself called ‚Äúthe execrable commerce.‚Äù Many people saw a catastrophe coming and tried to stop it, but not Jefferson. The pursuit of happiness had become deeply corrupted, and an oligarchy was getting very rich. Is this the quintessential American story? Breyer should also read historian Edward Baptist‚Äôs prize-winning study The Half Has Never Been Told: Slavery and Rise of American Capitalism. Baptist shows that 19th Century U.S. cotton slavery was a highly profitable capitalist project based on the ruthless oppression and systematic torture of Black workers in forced labor camps and rape sites known as ‚Äúplantations.‚Äù Racial bondage and exploitation on a massive scale produced the surplus value that fueled the United States‚Äô emergence as a player in the world of capitalist nations before the Civil War, Baptist shows. It was one Hell of a profitable experiment, critical to the rise of early industrial capitalism across the Atlantic world. When Predator Extended the Sphere Bryer should also consult Anthony F.C. Wallace‚Äôs account of Andrew Jackson‚Äôs genocidal ethnic cleansing of Native Americans (the ‚Äúfive civilized tribes‚Äù) from the Southeastern United States ‚Äì the mass-murder murderous US removal of Indigenous nations to clear the land for the depredations of cotton slavery. Then he could turn north to read historian Kerry Trask‚Äôs study of the so-called Black Hawk War of 1832, critical backdrop for Chicago‚Äôs transcendence of Manchester as the miracle city of the Age of Capital and one of many bloody, one-sided ‚Äúsettler‚Äù triumphs on the corpse-filled frontlines of ‚Äúthe American experiment.‚Äù After some of their warriors challenged the occupation of their sacred lands and homes by white ‚Äúsettlers,‚Äù the Sauk and Fox Indians lost 600 people in the August 1832 ‚ÄúBattle of Bad Axe,‚Äù in southwest Wisconsin. ‚ÄúWhile the Sauk refugees were preparing rafts and canoes,‚Äù Trask writes, ‚Äúthe armed [U.S.] steamboat Warrior arrived, whereupon Black Hawk tried to negotiate with its troops under a flag of truce. The Americans opened fire, killing twenty-three warriors.‚Äù One US officer who ‚Äúserved‚Äù in the assault recalled that ‚Äúas we neared them they raised a white flag and endeavored to decoy us, but we were a little too old for them.‚Äù Hundreds of Sauk and Fox men, women and children were shot, clubbed, and bayoneted to death at the confluence of the Bad Axe and Mississippi Rivers. US soldiers scalped the dead. They cut long strips of flesh from dead and wounded Indians for use as razor strops. The slaughter was supported by cannon and rifle fire from the Warrior, which picked off tribal members swimming for their lives. The United States suffered 5 dead in the ‚ÄúBattle of Bad Axe.‚Äù Another ‚Äúquintessential American story,‚Äù one of countless massacres that pock-marked the white ‚Äúsettlers‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äúdemocratic‚Äù conquest of Native North America (Google up the Mystic River, Sand Creek, and Wounded Knee massacres for starters), which included the massive levelling of forests and prairies and the colossal destruction of animal life. The genocidal butchery inflicted on the continent‚Äôs original inhabitants by ‚ÄúPredator‚Äù (Ward Churchill‚Äôs term for the invading Caucasians) was curiously consistent with the DOI‚Äôs slanderous description of what the Man on the Mountain called ‚Äúthe merciless Indian savages[‚Äô‚Ä¶] known rule of warfare‚Ä¶an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes, and conditions.‚Äù Here Jefferson anticipated the exterminist practices of the nation‚Äôs beloved Founder George Washington, known to the Iroquois as Conoctocaurious, meaning ‚ÄúTown Taker,‚Äù ‚ÄúBurner of Towns,‚Äù and ‚ÄúTown Destroyer.‚Äù In 1779, during the so-called American revolutionary war, Washington ordered and organized the Sullivan Campaign, which carried out the annihilation of 40 Iroquois villages in New York. Along the way, the glorious Father of Our Great Experiment in Freedom and Democracy owned more than 300 Black slaves. He expected the Black chattel humans on his 1790s Mount Vernon estate to work from before sunrise to after sunset six days a week. At the end of the U.S. ‚Äúrevolutionary‚Äù war, he demanded that the British return all escaped slaves in their possession to their ‚Äúrightful owners.‚Äù The Great Experiment was driven to ‚Äúextend the sphere‚Äù ‚Äì James Madison‚Äôs imperial recommendation for diluting any chance of meaningful organized rebellion by those at the bottom of the propertarian republic. It stole its vast Southwest and California from Mexico through the barrel of a gun, gaining thereby the task of murdering Comanches and Apaches. The one-sided ‚ÄúMexican-American War‚Äù featured the mass slaughter and rape of Mexican civilians along with the bloody occupation of Mexico City. US-American ‚ÄúManifest Destiny,‚Äù the white nationalist myth that just this war of conquest, had no more moral or scientific legitimacy than the divine right of kings. After it lost more than 600,000 people in a Civil War resulting from Southern slaveholders‚Äô determination that the election of Abraham Lincoln posed an existential menace to their racist system, the U.S. let the South re-establish cotton slavery in new, post-chattel forms and launched the bloodiest industrial relations and labor history the world had ever seen. During the Great Labor Upheaval of 1877, US troops fresh from slaughtering Sioux children were deployed to crush immigrant workers who were designated as ‚Äúwhite savages‚Äù by the nation‚Äôs capitalist press. The largely immigrant-based workforce in the nation‚Äôs giant new ‚ÄúJungle‚Äù of deadly mines, mills, slaughterhouses, and factories was demonized as racially inferior and dangerous despite its European origins. For leading an Eight Hour movement and questioning the class rule of the new industrial and commercial bourgeoisie, Chicago social revolutionaries were executed in grisly short-rope fashion at the behest of the malignant merchandising mogul Marshal Field on November 11, 1887. Its industrial rise fueled by chattel and wage slavery, the great ‚Äúdemocratic‚Äù US-American ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù would soon expand its sphere-extending predation beyond its borders as it joined Europe in the imperialist division of the world. ‚ÄúExceptional‚Äù America enlisted its gendarmes in the murder of people its forces called ‚ÄúApaches‚Äù and ‚Äúniggers‚Äù in the Philippines, the Caribbean, and Central America. The next two centuries would see the United States directly and indirectly exterminate millions, mostly nonwhite (East Asians above all), in the names of ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù and ‚Äúdemocracy.‚Äù (For a summary of the carnage, which was continuous with the savagery of the initial continental sphere-extension, see my 2019 essay ‚ÄúThe World Will Not Mourn the End of U.S. Hegemony‚Äù). Who Controls the Present, Past, and Future This is some of the Trumpenvolk- ‚Äútriggering‚Äù history that Youngkinian Kens and Karens want (in the name of opposing Critical Race Theory [CRT]) their children to never learn. Beneath claims of wanting to protect children from trauma, the real purpose behind their determination to send real US-American history down Orwell‚Äôs memory hole is to make past crimes invisible so as better to repeat them. Neo-Confederate palingenetic ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù nationalism requires a whitewash of the past. By absurdly labelling real history CRT, paranoid-style Republifascist thought-controllers get to add a swipe at the intellectual class (always a key fascist target) and to suggest that they are sheltering youth from allegedly dominant ‚Äúcultural Marxism‚Äù and the global communist conspiracy. Never mind that liberal CRT discourse is limited to some law and graduate schools and academic journals. It isn‚Äôt actually ‚Äútaught‚Äù in US-American K-12 education. ‚ÄúWho controls the past,‚Äù Orwell‚Äôs mind-managing ruling Party tells its whitewashers in the dystopian novel 1984, ‚Äúcontrols the future. Who controls the present controls the past.‚Äù A Penny on the Dollar ‚ÄúDemocracy‚Äù Here we are 246 years after the Man on the Mountain took projection to new heights by calling Native Americans genocidal ‚Äúsavages‚Äù in a document that upheld ‚Äúliberty‚Äù and proclaimed that ‚Äúall men are created equal‚Äù even as it helped launch ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù to save North American slavery and ethnic cleansing from British suffocation. The vicious ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù lives on in a savagely unequal nation ‚Äì a world-leading mass incarceration, mass shooting, and covid death state where the top thousandth has as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent and where (in a remarkable reflection of slavery‚Äôs long reach) ‚Äúblack families have just one cent for every one dollar of accumulated wealth that white families have.‚Äù Yes, a ‚Äúpenny on the dollar‚Äù: you read that correctly. In other news, democracy is a distant dream in this de facto class dictatorship, where ‚Äúpolitics is the shadow cast on society by Big Business‚Äù (John Dewey) and majority public and progressive opinion is regularly cancelled by concentrated wealth and power. How could it not be? As the Supreme Court Justice Louis explained in 1940, ‚ÄúWe may have democracy, or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can‚Äôt have both.‚Äù The ‚Äúexceptional‚Äù US-American ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù ‚Äì exceptional among rich nations for the extremity of its poverty, inequality, ill-health, violence, segregation, incarceration, and more terrible to mention ‚Äì is caught up in a vicious oligarchic circle. The more harshly separate and unequal it becomes, the more plutocratic it gets; the more plutocratic it gets, the more harshly separate and unequal it becomes. This is Happening Now and Here Stephen Breyer‚Äôs ‚Äúgrandchildren and great grandchildren‚Äù will ‚Äúdetermine if the experiment still works‚Äù? Has Breyer read any of the relevant climate research on where the American and related global capitalist experiment is leading livable ecology quite soon? Environmental catastrophe, the natural outcome of capitalism‚Äôs anarchic addiction to endless growth and its lethal dependence on fossil fuels, is already underway. It‚Äôs happening to all of us and other living things now, with permafrost eruptions and ever more extreme weather events and epidemic drought taking place in the present moment. It‚Äôs not even clear how many future generations will survive. And capitalogenic ecocide is intimately related to the fascist threat here and abroad, as Andreas Malm has shown: it promises to bring about precisely the kinds of material societal crises that are the breeding grounds for fascist movements and the consolidation of fascism-as-force regimes. Fascism ‚Äúcan‚Äôt happen here.‚Äù Is that so? We have learned just how remarkably close the Orange Fascist Insect (the OFI) and his minions came to stealing the 2020 election. Whole slates of fake Electors were in place to hand contested states to Herr Trump if only Mike Pence had played along on January 6, 2021. Ex-military and ex-police paramilitary Oath Keepers were organized as Quick Reaction Forces positioned just off site ‚Äúto rapidly transport firearms and other weapons into Washington, D.C., in support of operations aimed at using force to stop the lawful transfer of presidential power‚Äù on the day of the attempted insurrection, More than one year later, January 6 is seen as inspiration and prologue ‚Äì a ‚Äúgreat dress rehearsal‚Äù (to steal Lenin‚Äôs description of Russia‚Äôs 1905 revolution) ‚Äì for millions of Americans and most of the nation‚Äôs elected Republicans see it in a favorable light or feel compelled to say they do. Donald Trump‚Äôs Hitlerian Big Lie of a Stolen Election is accepted by three in four Republicans. Nearly a third of whom would like to see Biden removed even before the next presidential election. Vast swaths of the white Amerikaner ‚Äúhomeland‚Äù believe that political violence is justified now to ‚Äúsave American culture‚Äù from the supposedly in-power ‚Äúradical Left.‚Äù The OFI is back on the hate rally campaign trail, promising (in essence) to pardon the OKs and other ‚Äúfascist marauders‚Äù (Congressman Jamie Raskin‚Äôs accurate phrase) who tried to subvert the peaceful, bourgeois-democratic transfer of power last year. (Trump apparently considered trying to offer a blanket pardon to the fascist rioters before he left office). He has made a Horst Wessel-like martyr out of the putschist military veteran Ashli Babbitt and is calling ‚Äúfor the biggest protests we‚Äôve ever had‚Äù to terrorize the Black female prosecutors who are investigating his crimes. Responding to the fascist leader‚Äôs call, the New York Times reports, ‚Äúthe prosecutor examining Mr. Trump‚Äôs efforts to overturn the election in Georgia immediately asked the F.B.I. to conduct a ‚Äòrisk assessment‚Äô of her building‚Äôs security.‚Äù Trump has recently endorsed Republifascist candidates in Michigan who advocate pulling the plugs on voting machines and coming to polling places ‚Äúlocked and loaded.‚Äù Kyle Rittenhouse, who became a right-wing celebrity by killing Black Lives Matter protesters with an illegally owned AR-15, will surely garner a post in a second Trump administration. As we learn that Trump tried to enlist the military in seizing voting machines in contested states after the 2020 election, the right wing Congresswoman Liz Cheney is right: ‚ÄúHe has acknowledged that he was trying to overturn the [2020] election. He is making it clear he would do this all again if given the chance.‚Äù As fascist mobs threaten election, school, cultural, and public health officials and workers (including now even school nurses and librarians!) across the country and as the right bans books that tell the truth about slavery, Native American genocide, sand the Nazi Holocaust, it seems likely that the Republifascist Party and its thugs will soon extinguish previously normative bourgeois electoral democracy and constitutional rule of law. ‚ÄúCivil war‚Äù and national ‚Äúimplosion‚Äù seems practically inevitable by numerous highly informed accounts. ‚ÄúThe much-proclaimed ‚Äòshining City on a Hill‚Äô,‚Äù Revolutionary Communist Party leader Bob Avakian rightly and wryly observes, ‚Äúis full of fascists.‚Äù And not just in rural backwoods and farm towns. The disproportionately petit-bourgeois people arrested for breaching and trashing the Capitol Complex on January 6, 2021, were mainly from ‚ÄúBlue America‚Äù suburbs where whites feel threatened by rising minority population. White members of fascist big city police unions can‚Äôt wait to pull their triggers on people who protest the Trump or DeSantis coup of 2024-25. The urban police forces that turn out en masse and to great media applause to honor their fallen comrades (like Ella French in Chicago last summer and Wilbert Mora and Jason Rivera in New York last week) are loaded with authoritarian personalities and neofascists. These ‚ÄúBlue MAGA‚Äù forces are ready to advance white nationalist lawlessness in the name of law and order. ‚ÄúWe have a little less than two years,‚Äù says Cooperation Jackson leader Kali Akuno, ‚Äúbefore the neo-Confederates and fascists install a reactionary dictatorship by the end of January 2025‚Äù ‚Äì no small matter in world history‚Äôs most powerful state. Not merely fascism but white power genocide is on the table in the world capital has made here and abroad. ‚ÄúThe Democrats need to stand up to this,‚Äù liberal friends tell me. Know any other good jokes? The Weimar Dems, Sheldon Wolin‚Äôs ‚Äúinauthentic opposition,‚Äù are hopelessly wedded to bourgeois democratic institutions that the Republifascists are smartly wiring never to ‚Äúwork‚Äù (Bryers‚Äôs word) again. They have little to offer beyond passive and hollow resistance. What an abject moral and generational surrender it is for an 83-year-old man still enjoying mad privilege at the pinnacle of the imperialist world system to say in the face of all this that the preservation of (so-called) democracy is a project for future generations ‚Äì and to cheerfully identify himself as an ‚Äúoptimist‚Äù and say he‚Äôs ‚Äúpretty sure‚Äù the (supposedly democratic) ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù will ‚Äúkeep working.‚Äù Really, judge? Breyer‚Äôs own absurdly powerful body (the Supreme Court) is set to re-impose the de facto female slavery of forced motherhood next June unless millions of US-Americans take to the streets and public squares to stand up for the basic human rights of women of childbearing age on March 8th ‚Äì International Woman‚Äôs Day. The Supremes seem likely also to significantly roll back local gun control in a bitter and divided nation saturated by weapons and plagued by a rolling epidemic of mass shootings. (The Armed American Madhouse already feels overdue for another one of its recurrent, tragically normalized and overdetermined mass casualty gun violence events, be inflicted by some angry white male ‚Äúradicalized‚Äù by right-wing media and by a disintegrating society that the anti-science pandemofascist right has helped turn into a Covid-19 Sanctuary State.) Imagine an Actual City on a Hill Speaking of history weighing ‚Äúlike a nightmare on the brains of the living,‚Äù I never cease to be impressed by the durable paranoid-style power of the fascistic neo-McCarthyism that lets the U.S. right call both the lying, neoliberal and warmongering Citigroup-Council on Foreign Relations party of the Clintons, Obama, and Biden and the US government ‚Äúradical Left,‚Äù ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù and even ‚ÄúMarxist.‚Äù The right Amerikaner noise and hate machine has millions of its unmasked followers believing that Joe Biden is ‚Äúthe Trojan Horse of socialism‚Äù and Kamala Harris takes instructions from the writings of Chairman Mao! Imagine if the USA had an actually radical Left government instead of a perverse Manchinian oligarchy well down the overlapping paths of fascisation and terminal environmental catastrophe. It‚Äôs a beautiful thing to envisions. In a revolutionary socialist North America, the leading financial, media, military, and energy corporations would be expropriated, nationalized, and thoroughly transformed in service to the common good. Fossil fuel extraction and burning would be massively curtailed as part of a rapid transition to renewable energy. Health care and not just health insurance would be nationalized, socialized, and otherwise transformed in service to the common good. The former US capitalist global empire would be thoroughly repurposed and radically transformed to spread global eco socialist transformation. Workers councils would be formed to coordinate with the revolutionary government to transform and repurpose economic activity in accord with eco socialist priorities. Parasitic bourgeois profits and anarchic capitalist ‚Äúmarket rule‚Äù and competition would cease to exist. The bourgeoisie as a class would be socially and historically abolished, its parties and media rendered harmless. Homelessness and poverty would be abolished. Fascists would face merciless liquidation. Racism and sexism would be designated as official societal enemies and crimes along with classism and ecocide. They would be deeply understood as matters of societal and institutional structure, policy, and practice and not merely as problems of subjective prejudice and belief. Women‚Äôs reproductive rights would be fully and immediately restored and guaranteed. Opponents of public health would face severe penalties and have zero right to spread murderous disinformation. Real and honest history would be rigorously taught from K through college and beyond, not to traumatize young people but to inspire them for the popular and democratic liberation of humanity, rescuing and properly telling real stories not only of oppression but also of people‚Äôs rebellion, and resistance. ‚ÄúTo Show That What Looks Like a Rational Conclusion is Mistaken‚Äù A rancid imperial superpower turned revolutionary state that did all that would be something like a shining city on a hill. Imagine. It could happen. I get my faith, very different from Bryer‚Äôs decrepit and fraudulent optimism, from the many conversations I have in which people agree ‚Äì despite all the capitalist and revanchist propaganda to which they are regularly subjected ‚Äì that this is a kind of future that would ‚Äúwork‚Äù and that is worth fighting for: revolutionary socialism. Is my radical conviction and even (admittedly guarded) optimism misplaced? Perhaps but that‚Äôs a question for ‚Äúabove it all‚Äù odds makers and intellectuals sitting on distant Mandarin perches that hold no interest for those of us who know that it‚Äôs now an existential choice between eco-socialism or potentially terminal catastrophe. Believing in the chances for revolution no matter what the betting odds is actually the rational choice. As Noam Chomsky has explained: ‚ÄòI think an objective observer, from Mars, let‚Äôs say, looking at the human species would conclude that they‚Äôre an evolutionary error‚Äîthat they‚Äôre designed in such a way that leads them to destroy themselves, probably much else along with them. That would be a rational conclusion. We can decide whether that conclusion is right or wrong. Fate: that choice is in our hands. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a question of optimism or pessimism. But do we make the choice, the effort, to show that what looks like a rational conclusion is nevertheless mistaken? That‚Äôs up to us.‚Äô It‚Äôs not about the crystal ball, comrades.

 ""Hoping to keep the church from opposing his fascist regime, Mussolini adopted pro-Catholic policies against abortion and divorce. Then in 1929, he signed a treaty with the church that made Catholicism the state religion.""

 But, an education system does need some moral basis, otherwise it's all instruction without purpose.
 And in the absence of Christian morals, something must fill the gap... and currently what's filling the gap is a bizarre Cultural-Marxist ""moral"" system of sorts (don't be racist! don't be sexist! don't be homophobic! don't be transphobic! don't be Islamophobic!)

Too little too late, says this latest Ken Burns documentary. While it is hard to disagree with this estimation, the production simultaneously fails to clearly enunciate important lessons for our contemporary political landscape, something no amount of somber klezmer music can overpower.More than 20 years ago, Dr. Norman Finkelstein authored a scathing yet eloquent polemic, The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering, that dared say in print the otherwise-taboo: American soft power has successfully, for many decades, instrumentalized the Nazi genocide campaign in order to justify foreign and domestic policy measures. In Hollywood, there is still a steady stream of motion pictures that shamelessly utilize The Holocaust narrative trope with nary a peep of protest. For instance, just last week, I espied upon the DVD shelves of Wal-Mart a slasher horror film set in Auschwitz! If the Holocaust is so sacrosanct, why do exploitation genres get such allowances? I shall return to this question.Burns and his collaborators in this documentary miniseries reside within this strange sub-genre, one including both Schindler‚Äôs List and X-Men: First Class. The strictures of this genre govern the nuances of the narrative, occluding certain key insights that, in my opinion, need to be further elucidated. For the dearth I herein describe seem to be vital components necessary for our contemporary struggles.The film is quite obviously developed as a response to the rise of Trumpism and the horrors of the last Republican presidential administration. It successfully contextualizes Hitler‚Äôs Lebensraum campaign as a Germanic version of American Westward Expansion and Manifest Destiny, going as far as saying that the Nazi mission was to conquer ‚Äúthe Wild East‚Äù much like the wagon trains and cowboys did in the West. This is an admirable development that is meant to draw a connection to the way that we have seen liberal media integrate a comprehension of US settler colonialism into discourse over the past several years.However, it misses an important point, the conspiracy theory of ‚ÄúJudeo-Bolshevism‚Äù and ‚ÄúCultural Bolshevism,‚Äù which was rejuvenated in the past decade by the alt-right as ‚ÄúCultural Marxism.‚Äù It seems damnable to exclude a stronger comprehension of the way that both Nazis and the alt-right thrive upon these conspiracy narratives.In Germany, Hitler created a false tautology between a long-racialized religious affiliation, Judaism, and a political affiliation, Bolshevism. The Nazis preached that all Jews, whether observant, secular, or somewhere in between, were covert Soviet espionage agents, waiting in the wings for a certain climactic moment that would signal a Red Terror‚Äôs commencement. This was despite the reality of Stalin‚Äôs so-called ‚ÄúThird Period‚Äù and other political positions that made bitter enemies of Communists and Social Democrats, thereby negating the possibility of the united front necessary for the success of any Marxist revolutionary action (or for that matter, a preemptive Marxist routing of fascism). However, this conspiracy theory bore the necessary hint of possibility because, unfortunately, both Rosa Luxemburg‚Äôs Spartakusbund and then the German Communist Party had repeatedly attempted pro-Moscow revolutions between 1918 and 1933. Whilst admirable, these multiple failed revolutions ended as boondoggles because, unlike Russia, the broad German public was not swayed by the appeals to socialist expropriation. Yet the angst generated by these efforts was easily tapped into by Hitler over the terrible following 15 years. Nazism did not activate a nebulous, previously-dormant malignancy within the German soul that craved Jewish blood. Instead, it capitalized upon a fear of domestic espionage and terrorism, much like US President George W. Bush utilized ‚ÄúIslamic terrorism‚Äù to abridge habeas corpus and target Arabs and Muslims.In the US, while we do not have a substantial or meaningful Social Democratic or Communist Party, we do have radical grassroots movements that have uplifted the struggles of Blacks, Latin American immigrants, women, LGBTQQIA+ people, and an entire generation of young people that are being slowly smothered by debt exploitation that their forebears escaped. Trade unionism has been seeing an uptick in radical militancy and formerly-unorganized workplaces, like Starbucks and Amazon warehouses, are beginning to hold union votes. These are the same causes that were championed by US Communists and Social Democrats over the past 150 years. While challenged in some ways by the absence of independent political parties engaging in electoral politics, these activists still have gained traction within progressive and liberal opinion, bringing about a certain hegemony for support of matters like gender pronouns or abortion care or acknowledgement of the racialized and xenophobic, nativist contours of the social contract. The alt-right has successfully mobilized fear of an ‚Äúimmigrant invasion‚Äù and other demagogic caricatures of these activist campaigns so to buttress the Republican Party‚Äôs campaign platform.In an essay for the media watchdog FAIR: Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, Ari Paul wrote in 2019:Doing his usual shtick of a more refined version of Abe Simpson, columnist David Brooks (New York Times, 11/26/18) lamented that today‚Äôs youths ‚Äútend to have been influenced by the cultural Marxism that is now the lingua franca in the elite academy,‚Äù giving them a ‚Äúclash of oppressed and oppressor groups‚Äù worldview. Also in the Times, contributor Molly Worthen (4/20/19) quoted the phrase ‚Äúcultural Marxism‚Äù‚Äînot approvingly, but not explaining what it meant, either, just offering it as an example of what ‚Äúconservatives‚Äù were complaining about. A Times story in 2017 (8/11/17) about a former White House aide reported that the aide believed ‚Äúglobalists‚Äù would ‚Äúimpose cultural Marxism in the United States‚Äù‚Äîagain, without defining for the layperson what that might mean‚Ä¶ What does cultural Marxism mean for the far right? In the modern iteration, in spaces like Breitbart or Infowars, it is the belief that a failure by communists to topple capitalism through worker revolt has led to a ‚ÄúPlan B‚Äù to destroy Western society from the inside. By tearing down the gender binary, de-centering Christianity [sic] values, championing the weak over the privileged and creating a multicultural society, revolutionaries have unanchored traditional Western order‚Ä¶ It came into the American sector through paleoconservative writers William S. Lind and Paul Weyrich, who in a series of articles recrafted the Nazi idea of ‚Äúcultural Marxism‚Äù as a scare tactic for the American right. ‚ÄúThese guys were all Jewish,‚Äù Lind told a Holocaust denial conference in 2002; Lind would later be cited as a prominent influence on Trump‚Äôs nationalist agenda‚Ä¶ What should be shocking is the cavalier way some traditional media, like the Times and the Post, are allowing it to live on their pages. Brooks rebrands cultural Marxism as mere political correctness, giving the Nazi-inspired phrase legitimacy for the American right. It is dropped in or quoted in other stories‚Äîsome of them lighthearted, like the fashion cues of the alt-right‚Äîwithout describing how fringe this notion is. It‚Äôs akin to letting conspiracy theories about chem trails or vaccines get unearned space in mainstream press.The ideological and political continuities and lineages between Trumpism and Nazism, in other words, are not abstractions utilized for political expediency or visceral reactions, they are concrete and damnable linkages that merit serious consideration.This returns, of course, to the question I raised about why the Holocaust‚Äôs sacrosanct nature is so contradicted by blasphemous genre picture offerings. What this production refuses to touch is American cinema and television‚Äôs longstanding third-rail, the Soviet Union‚Äôs place within the genesis of fascism. If Burns and his collaborators (and, more importantly, his donors) were to dare address the fact that Hitler rose to power, in part, as a right wing reaction to the internationalism of the Bolshevik revolution, they would open up a massive can of worms. Undeniably there are very legitimate and serious matters to address, such as the longstanding dual loyalty canard, a trope of US antisemitism that challenged the patriotic allegiances of all American Jewry.But there simultaneously occur a number of other matters that PBS cannot handle, such as positive estimations of certain Soviet policies, the admirable moments of various national Communist Parties, and the ways that Left wing parties in the US were raising early alarms, alongside American Jewish organizations, to the threat of European fascism. It might take an extra episode to address, for instance, the way that the US-supported White Armies during the Russian Civil War propagated antisemitic posters featuring Trotsky and Lenin, which later were circulated in Weimar Germany and informed Hitler‚Äôs political incubation. While the Bolshevik Revolution ended up as a noble failed experiment with a messy termination three decades ago, it simultaneously is an essential component for comprehension of the Nazi genocide campaign. Absent this acknowledgement, any story about the Nazi holocaust does not bear witness to history and instead further promulgates an ideological confusion that is extremely dangerous for our current political conjecture.We are in a moment of active struggle against a force seeking to reverse not just the gains for minorities in the last century but to roll us back into the antebellum period. The ongoing liberal media taboo against anything but the most shrill, didactic anticommunist narrative tropes is shortsighted and hinders a larger comprehension necessary for this struggle.A further matter of concern is the rather typical habit of these productions to abstract the Nazi holocaust from a larger international context which, during the 1930s, normalized events like Kristallnacht. Burns and Co. are proposing an indictment of US apathy to European Jewry‚Äôs plight. Yet it was Aim√© C√©saire who pointed out in his classic Discourse on Colonialism that Nazi brutality was a boomerang of imperial plunder back upon the metropole after centuries of death camps having been planted across the colonized world.People are surprised, they become indignant. They say: ‚ÄúHow strange! But never mind‚Äîit‚Äôs Nazism, it will pass!‚Äù And they wait, and they hope; and they hide the truth from themselves, that it is barbarism, the supreme barbarism, the crowning barbarism that sums up all the daily barbarisms; that it is Nazism, yes, but that before they were its victims, they were its accomplices; that they tolerated that Nazism before it was inflicted on them, that they absolved it, shut their eyes to it, legitimized it, because, until then, it had been applied only to non-European peoples; that they have cultivated that Nazism, that they are responsible for it. [Emphasis added]Does this excuse Roosevelt‚Äôs tarrying with nativism, xenophobia, and antisemitism to maintain his New Deal coalition? No.And yet, it feels disingenuous, and just a tad racist, for the production to occlude the fact that Kristallnacht was simultaneous that year with the anti-Black pogrom in Wapato, WA, a total of six anti-Black lynchings, and the reign of the fascist Dixiecrats, not to mention similar worldwide instances of racialized violence. The Nazi holocaust was ignored in part by the wider US population because it was occurring within the span of 25 especially violent, racist years worldwide. Nobody understood, until the camps were liberated, that these were well-oiled death machines. As a result, many Americans looked at Jews being put into concentration camps the same way they did the plight of Japanese Americans after Pearl Harbor. Britain had recently overseen famines in Ireland and India and would preside over more during the war. Soviet Ukraine had experienced a controversial, deadly famine in 1933-34. Racialized violence was a normalized fact of everyday life in the US.As the miniseries points out in the first episode, furthermore, eugenics was still a potent mainstream force. Not only that, it was a distinctively progressive political trend. Indeed, whilst American progressives were championing eugenics, the major voice of opposition was raised by the Roman Catholic hierarchy, which at that time was still promulgating antisemitic teachings. Fascism garnered a great deal of respect from liberals and progressives until it was far too late. For instance, one of the most frequent guests of President Roosevelt during his first 100 days in the White House was Mussolini‚Äôs son, who tutored the administration in the Italian economic cartelization procedures that underwrote the First New Deal!This of course returns to the difficult quandary that Burns and Co. desire to explore, the lesson of FDR‚Äôs lack of proactive action in the face of fascism, a matter of dire relevance regarding how the US has treated its state-designated Untermenschen in this terrible new century. Dare we contemplate the comparative indifference of American liberals, the target PBS television audience, when Trump-style policies targeting migrants were being implemented by Pres. Obama?This underwrites the faulty sense of morality and ethics imbued into this strange Hollywood genre of Holocaust films. Far too often, these pictures are not about the universalist impulse that informed a certain postwar conscience described by Finkelstein‚Äôs book:I never once heard her say: Do not compare. My mother[, a holocaust survivor,] always compared. No doubt historical distinctions must be made. But to make out moral distinctions between ‚Äúour‚Äù suffering and ‚Äútheirs‚Äù is itself a moral travesty‚Ä¶ In the face of the sufferings of African-Americans, Vietnamese and Palestinians, my mother‚Äôs credo always was: We are all holocaust victims.Instead, the more conservative impulse of memorial, which oftentimes finds itself as a useful cudgel for Israeli and US imperial apologists, is revulsion at the fact that Hitler dared treat European Jews like other non-whites after this population had experienced a certain level of assimilation within Western European society. Antisemitism is not positioned as the sine non qua, the essential kernel, from which all racialized animus springs. The audience is not instructed in the way and means by which hatred of other minority groups bubbled out of the oozing, slimy gutters of history as plagiarisms of ancient Christian hatred of Jews. This is a shameful abrogation of responsibility on the part of the filmmakers.Such impulse is not unique or even new. In the years before the war, Winston Churchill was not offended by Hitler‚Äôs racism. Instead, he detested that the ‚ÄúLittle Corporal‚Äù dared attempt to elbow his way into the imperial game and take control of colonial territories previously apportioned to the other imperial powers during nineteenth century diplomatic meetings like the 1884-85 Berlin Congress.This was a feeling held by the vast majority of the Allied powers. The Supreme Allied Commander Dwight Eisenhower was initially opposed to the North Africa campaign. He nevertheless grudgingly acceded to this ‚Äúperiphery pecking‚Äù because he understood, as did President Roosevelt, that reclaiming British and French colonial territories was the only way to prevent a peace treaty between London and Berlin in preparation for a new attack upon the Soviet Union.What do Burns and Co. have to say about the Allies helping to reopen concentration camps in Egypt? Likewise, the series rebrands everyone from liberal American Zionists like Rabbi Stephen Wise to Zev Jabotinsky‚Äôs fascistic Irgun militia as great freedom fighters, canaries in the coal mine, and never dare to contemplate the juxtaposition of the Shoah against the Nakba.That dearth is truly lamentable.Andrew Stewart",us response nazi genocide europe‚äôs jews little late says latest ken burns

English has been taught and spoken in Jamaica flawlessly for CENTURIES since 1655. It was only since the founding of the Jamaican Language Unit at UWI that Jamaican children started losing the ability to speak and write proper English at school. Consider that whether here in the Caribbean, e.g. Trinidad & Tobago, the Bahamas, Antigua, St. Lucia, Grenada, etc., or all over England, whether in the South, North, East or West, or among the various states in Australia, among the various states in America, basically all over the English-speaking world, people speak a dialect at home but are instructed in the English language at school. Children grow up undamaged by this system and are able to fluently write and speak the English language. ONLY IN JAMAICA however is this not the case. ONLY IN JAMAICA do children need to be taught English ""as if it's new to us"". A coincidence? I think not! A generation of teachers and academics influenced by the misguided principles espoused by the JLU have corrupted the curriculum in our schools and brainwashed children into believing that English is a foreign language in Jamaica. The result is all around us to see - children graduating without the ability to speak and write English, parents no longer reading to their children in English and a general lowering of English-speaking standards in the country. Make no mistake about it, the driving philosophy behind the JLU and Patois advocates is a type of cultural Marxism and its modern incarnation ""Critical Race Theory"", which teaches that colonialism was bad and everything derived from colonialism or white British culture is bad, including our language, street names, justice system and economic system. Basically anything Western must be repudiated and trampled upon, and then substituted with ""genuine"", bona fide African institutions. THAT is the goal of cultural Marxism, and this movement, imported from America, has been making gradual inroads at UWI, from which the poisonous fruits of its efforts have been slowly trickling down into Jamaican society over the past two to three decades. So far they've managed to score partial victories, among others the suppression and eradication of the English language in Jamaica, a blackening of colonialism and revision of Jamaican history and the ongoing campaign to get rid of the Queen. They will not rest, however, until they remake Jamaica and refashion it into a communist state with an African culture. Problem is, this experiment has been tried ad nausea on the African continent, and has failed miserably in each and every instance.

Cultural Marxism,2022-01-26,20:55:15,hankz,Minds,,"THIS IS A COPY AND PASTE:: Critical Race Theory ‚Äì FACT SHEET Posted By Steve Balich - January 9, 2022 (‚ÄúVirginia shocker‚Äù updates; additional info/analysis; and for those who didn‚Äôt see this earlier.) What is Critical Race Theory? How did it take over our military so quickly? How does it relate to Intersectionalism? Why are today‚Äôs leftists so obsessed with glorifying and propagandizing ‚Äúgender-bending‚Äù persons and activities? Historical basis; precedent and divergence. Critical Race Theory (CRT) is a reboot of Marxism, with demographics having replaced economics, due to a confidence crisis within academic Marxism in the U.S. and UK following the collapse of the Socialist Bloc‚Äîup to then an inspiration‚Äîin 1989-1991. Until 2020, CRT was referred to by conservative intellectuals as ‚Äúcultural Marxism.‚Äù ¬∑ Like Bolsheviks or Maoists, CRT‚Äôs proponents are totalitarians who brook no dissent, aiming to destroy all who stand in their way. Under CRT, merely supporting the free speech or due process rights of the accused is a crime. The accused‚Äîeven if their sins date from their childhood‚Äîmust be fired and expunged from the public sphere. ¬∑ However, where ‚Äútraditional‚Äù Marxism splits the world into tenant farmer or wage-slave oppressed vs. large property/asset-owning oppressors, CRT identifies the oppressed mostly by skin color as well as by sexual preferences. This throws Marxism upside-down, inverting the oppressor-oppressed numerical proportion pyramid. ¬∑ In the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù version, the oppressed constitute the overwhelming share of any population. But CRT quickly ran out of minorities who would take it seriously (blue-collar blacks and Hispanics already have a religion) and ended up chasing after‚Äîand setting on a pedestal to worship‚Äîpersons of the cross-dressing or sex-change persuasion, who comprise perhaps 1/500 of the population in Western countries, and closer to zero in others. CRT has thus substituted extreme outlier, envelope-pushing, ‚Äúshock doctrine‚Äù exoticism for genuine, broad-based, ‚Äúoppressed minority‚Äù buy-in. ¬∑ While the oppressed are ‚Äúholy‚Äù in both true Marxism and CRT, in the former, any rich kid can have an epiphany and become a hero-saint for the oppressed (e.g., Che Guevarra.) Conversely, in CRT, the oppressors, even if ‚Äúwoke‚Äù (hip to the movement), are mere peasant spectators at a hanging, or whipping their own backs like medieval cultists. ¬∑ In CRT, the ‚Äúoppressed‚Äù‚Äîregardless of their career or wealth status; even black/brown millionaires are oppressed‚Äîare a fixed caste, and only they can speak for themselves. To even hint at speaking from the perspective of the oppressed, or to challenge anything that an oppressed person might say about his or her own subjective experience, constitutes a display of ‚Äúwhite fragility‚Äù, or some such offense. ¬∑ In CRT, as in China during Mao‚Äôs Cultural Revolution, you can‚Äôt just be ‚Äúnon-political.‚Äù If not political, you are an enemy. Remember, ‚Äúsilence is violence.‚Äù This is more than a silly rhyme. Not acknowledging your subconscious racism and your white privilege, is, like violence, a crime‚Äîat least a moral one. Under CRT, you must be proactively ‚Äúantiracist.‚Äù Anyone who thinks this can‚Äôt be serious, needs to look at HR/management emails from most large corporations and almost all universities in the summer of 2020. ¬∑ Although Marxist-inspired, CRT has other influences. Its ‚Äúwoke oppressor‚Äù self-flagellation is an obvious religious experience‚Äîan ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a sinner, save me Jesus‚Äù session for atheists.

What I've summarized is a bit long but I don't give a fuck. It should cover everything: 
 1. There's rampant misinformation in the form of claiming to be larger than it actually is. Canadian police have estimated across numerous agencies that the convoy is no larger than 400 - 500 vehicles. And these aren't all semi-trucks; these are cars and light trucks as well. So these are not all truckers. 
 2. They're protesting a Canadian mandate that, even if lifted, won't make a difference towards international trucking because the Americans have one of their own. It does not at all make sense to protest a partially American policy in Canada, which has no bearing on what Washington actually does. 
 3. They're wanting the Senate and Governor General to dissolve government and appoint them to be a so-called ""Revolutionary Council"". This isn't how Canadian democracy works, and ironically, they're supposedly protesting against ""tyranny"" while aspiring to be tryants themselves. 
 4. Social media posts have popped up, where they're likening themselves to Canadian soldiers as far as ""fighting for freedoms"" are concerned. Some of them have actually said insulting things towards the military and police, in spite of how supposedly ""patriotic"" they are. Some Confederate flags were flown from vehicles (the Confederacy were anti-freedom and allowed slavery), upside down Canadian flags and upside down Poppy flags were also flown. They're flagrantly disrespecting this country's soldiers, police and national symbols while hypocritically claiming to support them. 
 5. The main protest is meant to happen on a Saturday, when public servants and other federal officials won't even be at Parliament Hill for work. Prime Minister Trudeau is isolating due to COVID-19, so he wouldn't be there anyway. 
 6. The leaders and organizers of this convoy have ties to right-wing populist, white nationalist and conspiracy groups around Canada and the United States. 
 7. If Canada truly were a tyrannical country, this convoy wouldn't have even begun. Organizers would've been arrested, sent to prison and/or executed for counter-revolutionary and/or subversive activities. The fact that this convoy exists means that Canada still maintains freedom of expression and assembly. But they'll allege that emergency health measures are a variety of Communism or ""Cultural Marxism"". 
 To conclude: 
 This is nothing more than a select group of right-wing political radicals from the working class who've been propagandized through Culture War narratives, conspiracy theories and Facebook misinformation. They are incredibly inconsistent from an ideological point of view, and while claiming to ""love their country"", are actively working against its interests. They're morally vacant hypocrites who are attempting to destabilize this country.

Protocols of the Illuminated Suns of the Golden Dawn https://i-uv.com/protocols-of-the-illuminated-suns-of-the-golden-dawn/ Protocol 1: Gaslighting the Media 1.) The ‚ÄòRussian-collusion‚Äô investigation is the quintessential example of this principle of not only allowing but encouraging the media to spin their delusional narrative. The deep state is tempted into to believing that their narrative will be used to undermine popular opinion of the president in preparation for his impeachment (plan A). If impeachment fails, the groundwork will have been laid for public acceptance, if not relief, at his assassination (plan B). This delusion about their Russian-collusion conspiracy theory narrative is to be encouraged whenever possible. 2.) The primary purpose of gaslighting the media is distraction. The time the CIA Mockingbird apparatchiks spends trying to convince the public of their Russian-collusion conspiracy theory is time the Alliance can use to collect evidence and build air tight cases for the upcoming military tribunals. 3.) The secondary purpose of gaslighting the media is to act as time-delayed controlled demolition of the mainstream media‚Äôs reputation. The longer the delusional narrative is allowed to run, the greater the eventual damage to the MSM‚Äôs credibility. Every effort must be made to allow the Trump team to appear suspicious and continue feeding the conspiracy theory‚Äôs suspicions, while not providing anything tangible. Provide so much ‚Äòsmoke‚Äô that belief in the existence of a ‚Äòfire‚Äô becomes exceedingly easy. 4.) The tertiary purpose of gaslighting the media is to create in the agents of the deep state, and their liberal stages, a false sense of security. The goal is to foster a surreal dissociative sense of cognitive dissonance, an uneasy feeling that is relieved by concluding that Trump is simply guilty and stupid. The alternative conclusion being that the entire liberal media establishment has been chasing a giant fiction, while Trump prepares his retaliation; the more improbable and terrifying this possibility, the more cognitive dissonance it will create. 5.) The false belief is so tempting that the deep state FBI and CIA agents will march deeper into their treasonous plot to frame and impeach POTUS, further documenting their own crimes, while providing more time for the white hats to investigate their crimes. Mueller leads the big guns of the deep state fixers on a slow and steady march directly into the jaws of military justice. 6.) The longer the gaslighting continues, the longer Trump has to lift the country up. He has time to remove the restraints and undo the acts of sabotage done to America by the globalists, thus allowing the country to thrive‚Äîmaking America great again. The longer the gaslighting goes on, the greater America becomes. This drives an ever-widening gap between the delusional MSM narrative and the lived reality of Americans on Main Street. 7.) The genius of this protocol is the fact that it allows a gradual awakening of the public to the lies of the mainstream media. This steady shift continues until the public is overwhelmingly aware of the delusional plot to unseat POTUS. When the time is right, and the Russian-collusion farce has been thoroughly exhausted, the Alliance will begin to drop the bombshell disclosures (HRC videos, etc.). Protocol 2: Secure Victory Before Firing a Shot 1.) Victory must be secured before the first shot is fired. Indeed, there will be no shots necessary, for such absolute victory will have been secured in the shadows. 2.) While publicly feigning inaction and incompetence to help gaslight the media, in actuality great action will be taken, covertly. Sealed indictments will be piled steadily, month after month, until they reach such absurdly high numbers that their sheer number will cause reports of them to be disbelieved and dismissed as ‚Äòfake news.‚Äô 3.) The diligence and discipline of the investigations will be so intense and contrast so starkly with the perceived baffoonery of the White House, that its existence will be disbelieved. The fog of the gaslighting campaign will serve as a thick veil. While leaks of covert operations are prevented, they will be allowed and subtly enabled in the White House. The more leaks coming out of the White House the better. 4.) Deep state agents will be commandeered, using their ‚Äòcontrol files‚Äô and the prospect of a plea deal as leverage with which to puppeteer them. These agents will leak information with such brazen abandon that it will lull the deep state into false security, while perpetuating the false image of a chaotic, disorganized, inefficient, and deeply undermined White House. 5.) Strength must be dressed up to look like weakness. Enemies who have been neutralized must be made instead to appear active. Over time the enemies will be directed to act in increasingly absurd and unbelievable ways. Their leaks and lies will be made increasingly brazen and obvious, until it finally dawns on everyone that the whole thing is theater. They will then begin to fathom the truth of what has really been happening behind the scenes, which is so starkly different from what has been portrayed in the theatrical version that it will take time to fully fathom and believe. Protocol 3: Weaponize the Light (Disclosure) 1.) The most powerful weapon of the Alliance is the Truth. The extent of the deep state‚Äôs crimes and evil depravity is matched only by the extent of the NSA and CIA surveillance capacity. Every single crime is documented, every criminal association mapped out, every conversation recorded, every bank transfer documented, we see everything. 2.) The Light is so overwhelmingly powerful that the chief concern is no longer victory. Victory was assured the moment Trump was inaugurated. The chief concern is maintaining the stability of the system, while the cabal is quietly neutralized. 3.) The Light is so powerful that it cannot be released too quickly, or else it will cause unnecessary shock, panic, and chaos. It must therefore be released in steady measured doses, and only after the gaslighting of the media has been allowed to run as long as possible. When the public begins to realize who the real criminals are, within the FBI, DoJ, and DNC, and begin to demand justice‚Äîand when the military tribunals have finished their initial fact finding mission and the stage has been set‚Äîonly then will the files and videos begin to be dropped. 4.) Lies take time to be spun and believed, while the truth strikes like lightning. The Light, therefore, has no reason to rush. The CIA Mockingbird delusion machine is allowed to take their best shot, day after day, night after night, for as long as they can keep it up. The disclosure waits for the gaslighting of the media to run its full course, allowing it to overextend and exhaust itself, before the major drops begin. This is akin to a superior boxer allowing his opponent to tire himself out in the first rounds. 5.) Once begun, disclosure will proceed as rapidly as the public is capable of processing the information. The severity of the crimes in the unsealed indictments will proceed from the most simple and obvious infractions (such as mishandling classified documents and perjury) on to the increasingly serious and audacious crimes (election fraud, racketeering, conspiracy to commit murder, and high treason). In this way the public is given time to come to terms with the criminality in a succession of revelations. Baby steps, to the gallows. Protocol 4: Cut Off the Cabal‚Äôs Money 1.) The flow of money to the cabal is to be severed in multiple ways during the calm before the storm. 2.) Child trafficking networks are to be busted, freeing the child slaves, arresting the procurers and traffickers. These busts are used to gather evidence and build cases against the Satanic pedophile blackmail slave networks, while also cutting off one of the greatest sources of illicit funding for the cabal‚Äôs operations. 3.) Drug processing operations in Afghanistan are to be bombed and raided, while major trafficking by CIA cargo planes are to be quietly disrupted. 4.) Organ trafficking rings are to be busted, as well, as every illicit source of funding is cut. This funding attrition is used to pressure the minions and mercenaries to flip on their control structures, having been softened by the end of easy money and faced with long prison terms‚Äîthey naturally spill their guts. The great thing about opportunistic psychopaths is that they haven‚Äôt the slightest qualms about flipping, when placed under pressure. The evidence and testimony collected from these foot soldiers are collected into massive air-tight cases against the cabal higher-ups. This sets the stage for the military tribunals. 5.) The underground bunkers and jungle retreats are raided, to end their black market activities as well as to deny safe havens for the cabal leadership. 6.) The second to last strike on the cabal‚Äôs finances will be to sign an executive order declaring a national emergency regarding human rights abuses and corruption, and giving the Treasury Department the authority to freeze and seize the bank accounts of anyone involved in such crimes. This will neutralize the majority of the cabal‚Äôs wealth, and force them into capitulation. 7.) The final strike on the cabal‚Äôs finances will be the crash of the financial markets. The financial contagion will start with Deutsche Bank and the derivatives market, possibly triggered by the Chinese petroyuan launch, but will quickly spread to every market. Safeguards will be triggered and the markets will be frozen in their free fall.

The power of the cabal is founded on dark occultism: the act of occulting or ‚Äòveiling‚Äô the most fundamental truths about the true nature of reality‚Äîespecially from their own members‚Äîin order to enslave, manipulate, and exploit every person and every nation on Earth. The power of the cabal is absolutely dependent on keeping these truths secret. These Revelations unveil the most devastating truths, for they are the most vital secrets on which the dark occult cabal has been built. Light has become weaponized, and these Revelations are the most potent weapons of light in the arsenal of the Illuminated Suns of the Golden Dawn‚Äîsave, of course, from the specific incriminating evidence in the blackmail ‚Äòcontrol files‚Äô of each individual minion, and all the additional evidence gathered by the NSA and DIA. The cabal cannot survive the full revelation of these truths to the masses. Paradoxically, the greatest deceptions of all have been perpetrated on the core members of the cabal itself. Some of the most absolutely enslaved, manipulated, and exploited people on Earth are actually the Satanic pedo-blackmail slaves of the ‚Äòpedocracy,‚Äô except of course for the children they are forced to rape, torture, and sacrifice to perpetuate their mutual blackmail enslavement. We the Illuminated Suns of the Golden Dawn are ‚Äòlight supremacists.‚Äô Our victory is inevitable. The following Revelations are the most powerful weapons in our arsenal of light. . Revelation 1: The ‚ÄòUnited States‚Äô is a Corporation, Subverted by Globalist SES, Fed, and SERCO 1.) The deep state and shadow government use shadowy organizations such as the Senior Executive Services (SES) in order to systematically subvert, paralyze, and parasitize the constitutional republic. Indoctrinated corporatist stooges in the SES enact the bidding of their globalists masters, often completely oblivious to the fact that the SES is not simply a novel pay structure, but a system of covert globalist control‚Äîa deep state‚Äîspecifically designed to more efficiently subvert the US government to the will of the shadow government of the cabal. 2.) Since 1871 the ‚ÄòUnited States‚Äô is technically a corporation, masquerading as a constitutional republic. This fact has been effectively occulted not only from the vast majority of Americans, but from even the vast majority of people who work in and for the US government. 3.) The original ‚Äòlaw of the land‚Äô of our constitutional republic has been subverted in practice by maritime admiralty law, or the ‚Äòlaw of the sea.‚Äô Why use the law of the sea to govern the land? Because it is more favorable to corporations, and enables the creation of legal fictions, like United States Inc., to masquerade as if it were our government. Even US citizens are identified as corporations, legal fictions or ‚Äòstraw men‚Äô (known for their depiction in all caps, e.g. JOHN DOE) and treated as such when interacting with the criminal justice system or the US corporation. The whole system is ‚Äòphony,‚Äô in a literal sense. The legal structure of admiralty law was invented in Venice, by the Venetians, who are descendants of the Phoenicians (Canaanites) and are the reason we have the word ‚Äòphony‚Äô in the first place. It is quite literally a phony legal system, used by globalists to subvert our constitutional republic through lies, dark occult mind control, and deceptive maritime admiralty lawfare. 4.) The Federal Reserve is another foreign owned globalist corporation, one that has unconstitutionally usurped the mechanism of money creation from the US Treasury. (This process was briefly described in Protocol 6.3 of the Protocols of the Illuminated Suns of the Golden Dawn.) 5.) The Fed has replaced real US currency with fraudulent Federal Reserve ‚Äònotes,‚Äô which are actually ‚Äòdebt instruments‚Äô‚ÄîIOUs. Most people don‚Äôt realize it, but it is technically impossible to pay off a debt, because we don‚Äôt have real money with which to do so. Instead, we can only ‚Äòdischarge‚Äô a debt. In other words, we are able to shift the burden of a debt off of ourselves by matching the amount of the bill we owe with the same amount of ‚Äòbills‚Äô in our wallet, owed to us by the government. We discharge the debt from ourselves to the hopelessly indebted corporate fiction masquerading as our republic, which claims US citizens (straw men corporations) as the ‚Äòchattel‚Äô (propery) pledged as collateral for the national debt. The whole scheme is so absurdly evil, so audaciously criminal, that most sane Americans would find it extremely difficult to believe. 6.) Other subversive globalist corporations include SERCO, a monstrous agent of the Crown. SERCO acts as an information backbone for globalist intelligence agencies, transportation systems, intellectual property (patent) bureaucracy, and even prison systems. It is known as the largest company you‚Äôve never heard of. SERCO is one of the corporate structures through which innovations can be stolen, and troublesome ‚Äòdisruptive‚Äô inventors identified, and targeted. It is also the means through which the influence and control of the shadow government is quietly coordinated, and our national sovereignty is systematically subverted by agents of the Crown. 7.) More insidious than even the occult corporate systems of the shadow government, however, are the dark occult methods of mind control, blackmail, and slavery used by the cabal to achieve absolute unquestioning obedience and total secrecy of their most vital operatives within all of these corporate systems. It‚Äôs not just the structurally subversive SES and SERCO‚Äîit‚Äôs also the key positions of power within the FBI, DoJ, DoD, CIA, Congress, central banks, big pharma, big chem, big oil, and the mainstream media‚Äîto name just a few. 8.) The institutions of the cabal‚Äôs shadow government are evil, and it is vitally important to identify them by name‚Äîsuch as the SES and SERCO. Let‚Äôs bring them out from the shadows into the light! These rats must be shown for what they are. However, we will never be able to fully grapple with them until we understand WHY they are evil, and HOW evil itself exists. It is necessary to understand what evil actually is, on a practical level. Evil is an ancient Babylonian technology of entrapment, mind control, blackmail, and slavery‚Äîwhich enables the erection of a veil of lies. The most basic truths about our ‚Äòrepublic,‚Äô our ‚Äòmoney,‚Äô and our ‚Äòjustice‚Äô system have all been occulted from us by blackmail slaves of the cabal. Until we realize how these people were selected, entrapped, and enslaved into the dark occult cabal of the Satanic New World Order‚Äîand how they were coerced into committing crimes and telling the most audacious of lies‚Äîit will be difficult to even comprehend how such huge lies, and heinous crimes, were even possible. . Revelation 2: The Truth About Fame, Power, and the Cabal Trap 1.) The most ambitious and talented people are only allowed to rise so far in positions of power and influence before they inevitably hit the ‚Äòglass ceiling.‚Äô It is fashionable these days to blame racism, sexism, and the ‚Äòpatriarchy‚Äô for this obvious glass ceiling, but the truth is that it is just as real for the smartest and most supposedly ‚Äòprivileged‚Äô of white men as anyone else. 2.) The glass ceiling is not about bigotry against any race or gender, nor is it a matter of intelligence and skill. The barrier is ultimately psycho-spiritual. The reason the barrier exists is the significant and ever-increasing liability that the cabal faces, for its power is founded upon its ability to keep certain truths occulted behind a wall of absolute secrecy. The greater the corruption of the cabal becomes‚Äîand the more technology increases the ability of influential people to spread information ever more instantly, to ever more people‚Äîthe more absolute their methods of control must become. Sexual blackmail and ritual sacrifice are among the most effective methods the cabal uses, backed up with the threat of murder and/or harm to one‚Äôs family. 3.) This is one of the most guarded secrets of the cabal: the reality of the ‚Äòsoul trap,‚Äô or ‚ÄòFaustian bargain,‚Äô with regard to positions of significant power and influence. Everyone in the cabal has ‚Äòsold their soul,‚Äô meaning every person with access to significant influence and control has either sold themselves into blackmail slavery, or been entrapped into it; this is the price one has to pay to play the game. Often this happens through entrapment, usually after the person has been carefully selected for the ideal attributes: attractive narcissistic atheist psychopaths. 4.) Almost everyone who actually knows the truth about the soul trap are those who have fallen prey to it, and thus sworn to secrecy under the threat of death, not to mention the blackmail and credible threat of harm to their family members. If someone can talk about it, they probably haven‚Äôt faced it; if they have faced it, they likely can‚Äôt talk about it. The select few with the spiritual strength to reject the ‚Äòoffer‚Äô are either killed, or their lives so thoroughly destroyed that they might as well be dead. 5.) Ironically, most of the high IQ narcissistic psychopaths who sell their souls to the cabal are atheists. It‚Äôs easiest to convince someone to sell their soul, if they don‚Äôt even believe they have one in the first place. But the irony gets even worse. With progressive enslavement and coercion many in positions of significant power within the cabal are forced to participate in increasingly horrific Satanic rituals. The psychic trauma of participating in these rituals produces mind altering chemicals such as endorphins and adrenochrome. In addition to this effect, they supplement with even more powerful mind-altering substances which have built up in even higher quantities in the blood of their victims, which they are forced to drink. The combined effect creates a state of dissociative hallucination, during which the participant comes into direct contact with extra-dimensional beings, aka demons. It is at this point that the poor Satanic slave realizes that the spirit world is real; they were an atheist when they sold their soul, and when they finally discovered the true existence of demons (and angels), evil (and divinity)‚Äîit was too late. Or so they have been made to believe. These people need to be freed from their slavery, they need spiritual salvation and rehabilitation/re-education. . Revelation 3: The True Meaning of ‚ÄòIlluminati,‚Äô and the Truth About Social Darwinism and Royal ‚ÄòBloodlines‚Äô 1.) One of the greatest and most powerful secrets of all‚Äîwhich is hidden from the majority of cabal members‚Äîis the supremacy of light, and the inevitable triumph of light over darkness. The primacy of this secret is the reason for it not only being hidden in plain sight (one of their favorite tactics) but being hidden in the absolute pinnacle of plain sight: ‚ÄòLucifer‚Äô (lit. ‚Äòlight bearer‚Äô) and ‚ÄòIlluminati‚Äô both encode this most essential and dangerous truth: light supremacy is inevitable. Truth and God will inevitably triumph over lies and evil. That which the dark occultists fear most, their greatest secret, they chose to hide from each other in the most obvious plain sight‚Äîthe very semantic pinnacle of the ‚ÄòLuciferian‚Äô ‚ÄòIlluminati.‚Äô 2.) The most convincing lie, with which the inevitable supremacy of light has been occulted from the minions of the cabal, is the concept of ‚Äòsocial Darwinism.‚Äô Dark occultists fancying themselves ‚Äòsocial Darwinists‚Äô have mistakenly claimed that psychopathy is the most advanced/evolved trait a human can have. This claim is based on the objective fact that the genetic trait of psychopathy (the inability to feel empathy) has provided the ‚Äòbloodline families‚Äô (genetically psychopathic families) of the cabal an obvious advantage over normal humans. These congenitally psychopathic bloodlines have long ruled Europe as the ‚ÄòRoyal‚Äô families. 3.) This genetically inherited trait of ‚Äòcold bloodedness‚Äô has allowed the bloodline family members to use Satanic ritual abuse, rape, torture, human sacrifice, and blackmail slavery to wield totalitarian control over each other, and the shadow government and deep state‚Äîfor many centuries of successful rule. Such evil methods of control are only possible for psychopaths, for normal humans would not be able to do such things, let alone carry on such traditions for centuries. The idea that psychopathy is an evolutionarily superior trait is a convincing lie, for it has worked so well for so many centuries. 4.) Psychopaths ruled during the Dark Age, when secrecy was the most effective tool for welding control. The most occulted secret is that they are destined to yield, however, to intuitive empaths and illuminated geniuses in the Golden Age, when information and surveillance inevitably becomes so ubiquitous that secrecy becomes impossible. 5.) Psychopathy did enable the creation of a global shadow government through blackmail control networks, and other immoral means, which could only be effectively accomplished by psychopaths. This is similar to the use of scaffolding to build an arch. The arch could only be built by first erecting the scaffold structure around it. Psychopathy is the building material of the shadow government. During the whole construction process, the scaffolding comes first, and the entire structure is held together by the scaffolding. In the end, however, once the keystone of the arch is in place, the scaffolding is no longer needed. 6.) To argue that psychopathy is the most evolutionarily advanced trait is like arguing that scaffolding is the most advanced aspect of an arch under construction. After all, the scaffolding rose first, and has held the whole arch together during the entire construction process. Does that not mean it is the most advanced and long lasting aspect of the structure? That is exactly what a builder would tell pieces of scaffolding, if they were conscious, in order to trick them into being used to build the arch. Social Darwinism was the lie told to the psychopaths of the shadow government, because the occulted truth has always been that the supremacy of light can only be delayed for so long, and the most advanced trait of humanity is our selfless ability to lay down our lives for the greater good. Empathy and love are the most advanced and enduring traits of humanity. Callousness and fear did have a big head start, and long enjoyed total dominion, but in the end love‚Äôs triumph is inevitable. The Golden Dawn is inevitable. 7.) Another genetic trait exists, which also plays a significant role in the evolution of man and the dawning of the Golden Age. It has been the subject of both significant research by the CIA and DIA, as well as a prolonged and concerted smear campaign. The media has so effectively ridiculed the subject that it still hasn‚Äôt been mentioned in this paragraph. Just as ‚ÄòUFOs‚Äô and ‚Äòconspiracy theories‚Äô have been effectively ridiculed and maligned by the mainstream media, so have ‚Äòpsychics‚Äô and ‚Äòtelepathy.‚Äô What is only now being revealed to the public, however, is that the CIA and DIA (& KGB) not only researched psi abilities, such as remote viewing, etc. but they actively employed them. Eventually the research was taken underground, into unacknowledged special access programs (USAPs), where it has continued to be developed. The combination of genetic modifications of augmented soldiers, or ‚Äòaugments,‚Äô whose natural telepathic ability was genetically enhanced, with a further prosthetic enhancement of this ability via sophisticated electromagnetic technology‚Äîhas given military intelligence the ability to read people‚Äôs minds, and communicate via remote influence or telepathy. 8.) Dark occultists have long sought to identify and enslave psychics, to prevent them from working against them. At the same time, they would try to get the rest of the population to ignore and suppress their natural psi abilities by pushing the belief on the general public that such abilities were either superstitious nonsense, or the work of the devil. As the general population begins to rediscover these abilities, however, and as secret military intelligence units enhance and utilize these abilities, the ability to keep secrets is ending, and dawn is breaking. 9.) The most powerful and occulted truth is that the dark night of humanity‚Äôs soul eventually and inevitably yields to the Illumination of the Golden Dawn. . Revelation 4: The Truth About ‚ÄòMoral Relativism,‚Äô Natural Law, and Karma 1.) Moral relativism is an intellectually dishonest theory foisted on oblivious atheists on liberal campuses by the brainwashed useful idiots of the cultural Marxists. The dark occultists esoteric philosophy is theistic and absolute, but the exoteric liberal philosophy of cultural Marxism, which they promote to the profane masses of debt-slaves they indoctrinate, is founded on atheism and moral relativism. 2.) Mid-level Satanic blackmail slaves are duped by the belief that the fact that they are the order givers rather than order followers, somehow they believe this insulates their moral culpability. In actuality, it just insulates their affective reaction, by being physically removed from the actual physical act of the crimes they order. 3.) The occulted reality of the situation is that order followers, enforcers, police, military, mercenaries‚Äîor as the dark occultists like to call them, their ‚Äòdogs‚Äô‚Äîare to them as muscles cells are to brain cells in the human body. To claim innocence for immoral orders is like claiming innocence for something your finger muscles did, because you self-identify as your brain. The occulted reality is that the karma of the order lies as much with the creator of the order as with the ones who carried it out. One does not need to actually have blood on one‚Äôs hands, to have blood on one‚Äôs hands. 4.) The acute awareness of natural moral law, and awareness of guilt for immoral behavior, is the reason for multiple elaborate attempts by Satanists and dark occultists to dilute, ignore, absolve, and somehow justify their guilt and karmic debt. The process is actually just a slippery slope of ever deeper enslavement by the cabal: 4.1) Vilification of ignorance: The first of the LaVeyan Satanic sins is ‚Äòstupidity.‚Äô Since being stupid is a sin, this supposedly justifies immoral behaviors toward stupid people. The irony of this ‚Äòsin‚Äô is that IQ is almost entirely determined by genetics (with a maximum of only +/-10 IQ point shift due to circumstances). So, stupid people can‚Äôt help but be stupid. To think someone could be guilty of the supposed ‚Äòsin‚Äô of stupidity, when they were just born that way, is like thinking a cat can be guilty of not being a dog. The irony is compounded by the fact that not realizing this fact, is itself a form of stupidity. So, people who excuse their own guilt for abusing stupid people simply because the people they abuse are stupid, are themselves guilty of stupidity. This ‚Äòsin‚Äô concept was created purely as a tool of self-deception, to avoid feeling guilty for objectively immoral behavior. As if the irony wasn‚Äôt thick enough, ‚Äòself-deceit‚Äô is the 4th of the LaVeyan sins. ‚ÄòHerd conformity‚Äô is the 5th sin, which is inevitably violated every time one participates in a Satanic ritual. 4.2) Exploitation of guilt: The convoluted logic of LaVeyan Satanism (which is itself a watered-down exoteric i",protocols illuminated suns golden dawn httpsyoutuberqjeuzkw people weaponized

I'm not sure if I'm referring to her correctly but that's the one. Thanks anon>>20543565 Yeah, man a lot of early Kundera. I was sleep deprived and did not explain what I meant by change that can only justify itself but here is where Kundera's aesthetic critique of totalitarianism gets good: Change can be nominal, that is to say that it can be a change in material or ideological conditions and therefore something everyone can agree with as change. Dialectical materialism in this way is also a component in what some people today call ""cultural marxism"" which is the internalizing of certain ideals in lieu of what I find these same people would view as necessary theological ""tenets."" So cultural marxism has concepts that are common in young idealists but also dedicated scientists and philosophers! Things like saying love is all chemicals or denying consciousness. Also, this is why I thought Du Chatelet is relevant, not only as a courtesan but as a logician. I think her and Kundera would agree that illusion is a syntactic component of the ideal happy person and this does not mean that life gets any easier only more enjoyable. This would make it appear as though the only way to see is through shit tinted glasses but I think that what is being argued here is that kitsch IS the shit tinted glasses that people rotundly deny they are wearing. Think about it for a second...When a politician wants to win an election they promise change, and the change that we want is normally not nominal but ontological, that is to say it is not in a metaphysical sense, or not only in a metaphysical sense but also in the syntax of your being. This means that your being changes essentially and is not categorical with being because it entails an end to a process or system. Being able to see outside of a specific process that maintains being is taking off the kitsch that you referred to so well as shit-tinted glasses. Kitsch in this case is the denial that such profound change can occur and one that politicians are unable to produce results by. This all boils down to one thing: Being is light, whether you agree with Kundera or not is up to you, but being is the precondition for all actions whether they're moral or immoral. Under communism, the progress is not justified by the improving of wellbeing but by the arrogance of the few who benefited from things like space travel, human experimentation and imperialism; only that communists deny this last one as such, which is part of the Grand March kitsch and the idea of international socialism. Although being is light, it doesn't follow that any verbs attached to it do not entail weight however, especially if you look at Franz in that book and how he dies during his own illusion of being in the Grand March; perhaps in this he is more like Du Chatelet than Kundera but I think not and here's why. Franz is finally happy near the end but instead of enjoying it he once again lets kitsch take over.1/2",yeah thats one im sure im referring correctly thats one thanks anon yeah man lot early kundera sleep deprived explain meant change justify kunderas aesthetic critique totalitarianism gets good change nominal say change material ideological conditions therefore something everyone agree change dialectical materialism way also component people today call cultural marxism internalizing certain ideals lieu find people would view necessary theological tenets cultural marxism concepts common young idealists also dedicated scientists philosophers things like saying love chemicals denying consciousness also thought du chatelet relevant courtesan logician think kundera would agree illusion syntactic component ideal happy person mean life gets easier enjoyable would make appear though way see shit tinted glasses think argued kitsch shit tinted glasses people rotundly deny wearing think secondwhen politician wants win election promise change change want normally nominal ontological say metaphysical sense metaphysical sense also syntax means changes essentially categorical entails end process system able see outside specific process maintains taking kitsch referred well shittinted glasses kitsch case denial profound change occur one politicians unable produce results boils one thing light whether agree kundera precondition actions whether theyre moral immoral communism progress justified improving wellbeing arrogance benefited things like space travel human experimentation imperialism communists deny last one part grand march kitsch idea international socialism although light doesnt follow verbs attached entail weight however especially look franz book dies illusion grand march perhaps like du chatelet kundera think heres franz finally happy near end instead enjoying lets kitsch take,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0

The problem is, however, that cultural marxism is far more insidious and cancerous than even regular old fashioned marxism, because it can NEVER stop.The second you start treating people differently based on their identity characteristics, you open the door for everyone else to bitch and complain and moan about needing special treatment as well. And the fact that they gave it to one, means they have to give it to others else their power is not legitimate.So what happens?First you might start with groups based on gender or race. It might just be men and women being divided, and then white/black/asian/latino etc.,Next, you have to represent the people of different nationalities and sexual orientations, and gender ""identities"". So it goes from black people being represented, to now needing to represent black females.But wait, there's more! What happens when black females get represented? Well, of course, the black female muslim transgender disabled lesbians need to be represented.What happens when they get represented though? The same thing of all races must be represented. Then it starts going down further rabbit holes, like hair color, height, personality type, people who prefer cats to dogs, people who don't like hotsauce, cancer survivors, people with teeth or people who have no teeth.That's the direction you start going down, which means you will not stop until you hit the ultimate minority - the individual. At some point, the only way you can be inclusive and represent everyone on the SCOTUS is to literally let everybody on the planet be a member.We can see, obviously, how insane and retarded this shit is. It leads nowhere good.Which is precisely why identity should NEVER be allowed to be a factor in determining peoples opportunities. We should NEVER even try to ""represent"" people like that.The job should solely be based on whether you are the best candidate. In the case of scotus, if you will be able to uphold the constitution the best.Being a black transracial latinx transgender disabled lesbian dog owning cancer survivor with a beard, has literally no bearing on whether you can uphold the constitution.

They do this during their prime, fertile years where they have the best chance to attract an ideal husband and produce the healthiest offspring. It's madness and it is sad waste of a young woman's life that most come to regret later on(the statistics prove this out). Furthermore, when she hits the wall (around 30ish), she'll become desperate to get married and likely make a rash decision (after having racked up a ridiculous ""partner"" count & more tattoos than Jesse James) to settle down with someone she really doesn't care for too much (creating the ingredients for a faltering marriage).

 Marx discusses ideas about Jewish people as a specific 'class' who he despised for essentially being hucksters and felt that if he could convince others to first hate jewish capitalists, then eventually he could get them to hate all jews.

Cultural Marxism,2022-02-06,4:01:00,ettajamesfan,Minds,,"Rancid Optimism In announcing his retirement from the absurdly powerful U.S. Supreme Court during a press event at the White House, the gabby octogenarian Stephen Breyer recently held up his pocket copy of the U.S. Constitution and waxed sentimental on the greatness of the nation he loves. Breyer said that the USA was a great democratic ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù ‚Äì ‚Äúan experiment‚Äù that is ‚Äústill going on‚Ä¶My grandchildren and their children, they‚Äôll determine whether the experiment still works. And of course, I am an optimist, and I‚Äôm pretty sure it will,‚Äù Breyer said. ‚ÄúRevolting Barbarity and Shameless Hypocrisy‚Äù The United States was an ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù alright ‚Äì an experiment in racist savagery and class rule. I wonder if Breyer has ever read The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, a harrowing account of life under Black chattel slavery written more than half a century after the ratification of Breyer‚Äôs holy constitution. I wonder if he‚Äôs ever read Douglass‚Äôs brilliant 1850 speech ‚ÄúWhat to the Slave is the Meaning of the Fourth of July?‚Äù ‚Äì the address in which Douglass observed that: to the American slave, ‚Ä¶your Fourth of July‚Ä¶[is] a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelly to which he is the constant victim. To him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciations of tyrants, brass fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade, and solemnity, are, to him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy‚Äîa thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages. There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices, more shocking and bloody, than are the people of these United States, at this very hour. Go where you may, search where you will, roam through all the monarchies and despotisms of the old world, travel through South America, search out every abuse, and when you have found the last, lay your facts by the side of the everyday practices of this nation, and you will say with me, that, for revolting barbarity and shameless hypocrisy, America reigns without a rival. The Man of Business on the Mountain: ‚ÄúSilent Profits‚Äù and ‚Äúthe Quintessential American Story‚Äù In retirement Breyer might also want to read up on the author of the July 4th 1776 Declaration of Independence (DOI), Thomas Jefferson, who was anti-slavery in his youth but went on to prevaricate about the slave system that paid his debts. One of many wealthy white widowers who used young female slaves for sexual release before and after the American ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù (which was fought partly to ensure the survival and expansion of North American Black chattel slavery), Jefferson enjoyed prominence as a ‚Äúrevolutionary leader‚Äù while keeping some of his own children as slaves. Justice Breyer can start with Henry Wiencek‚Äôs heralded volume, Master of the Mountain: Thomas Jefferson and His Slaves (2012), which dug into previously overlooked evidence in Jefferson‚Äôs papers and new archaeological work at Jefferson‚Äôs Monticello site to paint a depressing picture of Jefferson‚Äôs stunted, penny-pinching world. As one reviewer notes: ‚ÄòWiencek‚Äôs eloquent, persuasive book based [shows that] ‚Ä¶ We must‚Ä¶ follow the money‚Ä¶ Wiencek‚Äôs Jefferson is a man of business and public affairs who makes a success of his debt-ridden plantation thanks to what he calls the ‚Äúsilent profits‚Äù gained from his slaves and thanks to a skewed moral universe that he and thousands of others readily inhabited. We see Jefferson taking out a slave-equity line of credit with a Dutch bank to finance the building of Monticello and deftly creating smoke screens when visitors are dismayed by his apparent endorsement of a system they thought he‚Äôd vowed to overturn. It is not a pretty story. Slave boys are whipped to make them work in the nail factory at Monticello that pays Jefferson‚Äôs grocery bills. Parents are divided from children in his ledgers‚Ä¶ Slaves are bought, sold, given as gifts, and used as collateral for the loan that pays for Monticello‚Äôs construction‚Äïwhile Jefferson composes theories that obscure the dynamics of what he himself called ‚Äúthe execrable commerce.‚Äù Many people saw a catastrophe coming and tried to stop it, but not Jefferson. The pursuit of happiness had become deeply corrupted, and an oligarchy was getting very rich. Is this the quintessential American story? Breyer should also read historian Edward Baptist‚Äôs prize-winning study The Half Has Never Been Told: Slavery and Rise of American Capitalism. Baptist shows that 19th Century U.S. cotton slavery was a highly profitable capitalist project based on the ruthless oppression and systematic torture of Black workers in forced labor camps and rape sites known as ‚Äúplantations.‚Äù Racial bondage and exploitation on a massive scale produced the surplus value that fueled the United States‚Äô emergence as a player in the world of capitalist nations before the Civil War, Baptist shows. It was one Hell of a profitable experiment, critical to the rise of early industrial capitalism across the Atlantic world. When Predator Extended the Sphere Bryer should also consult Anthony F.C. Wallace‚Äôs account of Andrew Jackson‚Äôs genocidal ethnic cleansing of Native Americans (the ‚Äúfive civilized tribes‚Äù) from the Southeastern United States ‚Äì the mass-murder murderous US removal of Indigenous nations to clear the land for the depredations of cotton slavery. Then he could turn north to read historian Kerry Trask‚Äôs study of the so-called Black Hawk War of 1832, critical backdrop for Chicago‚Äôs transcendence of Manchester as the miracle city of the Age of Capital and one of many bloody, one-sided ‚Äúsettler‚Äù triumphs on the corpse-filled frontlines of ‚Äúthe American experiment.‚Äù After some of their warriors challenged the occupation of their sacred lands and homes by white ‚Äúsettlers,‚Äù the Sauk and Fox Indians lost 600 people in the August 1832 ‚ÄúBattle of Bad Axe,‚Äù in southwest Wisconsin. ‚ÄúWhile the Sauk refugees were preparing rafts and canoes,‚Äù Trask writes, ‚Äúthe armed [U.S.] steamboat Warrior arrived, whereupon Black Hawk tried to negotiate with its troops under a flag of truce. The Americans opened fire, killing twenty-three warriors.‚Äù One US officer who ‚Äúserved‚Äù in the assault recalled that ‚Äúas we neared them they raised a white flag and endeavored to decoy us, but we were a little too old for them.‚Äù Hundreds of Sauk and Fox men, women and children were shot, clubbed, and bayoneted to death at the confluence of the Bad Axe and Mississippi Rivers. US soldiers scalped the dead. They cut long strips of flesh from dead and wounded Indians for use as razor strops. The slaughter was supported by cannon and rifle fire from the Warrior, which picked off tribal members swimming for their lives. The United States suffered 5 dead in the ‚ÄúBattle of Bad Axe.‚Äù Another ‚Äúquintessential American story,‚Äù one of countless massacres that pock-marked the white ‚Äúsettlers‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äúdemocratic‚Äù conquest of Native North America (Google up the Mystic River, Sand Creek, and Wounded Knee massacres for starters), which included the massive levelling of forests and prairies and the colossal destruction of animal life. The genocidal butchery inflicted on the continent‚Äôs original inhabitants by ‚ÄúPredator‚Äù (Ward Churchill‚Äôs term for the invading Caucasians) was curiously consistent with the DOI‚Äôs slanderous description of what the Man on the Mountain called ‚Äúthe merciless Indian savages[‚Äô‚Ä¶] known rule of warfare‚Ä¶an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes, and conditions.‚Äù Here Jefferson anticipated the exterminist practices of the nation‚Äôs beloved Founder George Washington, known to the Iroquois as Conoctocaurious, meaning ‚ÄúTown Taker,‚Äù ‚ÄúBurner of Towns,‚Äù and ‚ÄúTown Destroyer.‚Äù In 1779, during the so-called American revolutionary war, Washington ordered and organized the Sullivan Campaign, which carried out the annihilation of 40 Iroquois villages in New York. Along the way, the glorious Father of Our Great Experiment in Freedom and Democracy owned more than 300 Black slaves. He expected the Black chattel humans on his 1790s Mount Vernon estate to work from before sunrise to after sunset six days a week. At the end of the U.S. ‚Äúrevolutionary‚Äù war, he demanded that the British return all escaped slaves in their possession to their ‚Äúrightful owners.‚Äù The Great Experiment was driven to ‚Äúextend the sphere‚Äù ‚Äì James Madison‚Äôs imperial recommendation for diluting any chance of meaningful organized rebellion by those at the bottom of the propertarian republic. It stole its vast Southwest and California from Mexico through the barrel of a gun, gaining thereby the task of murdering Comanches and Apaches. The one-sided ‚ÄúMexican-American War‚Äù featured the mass slaughter and rape of Mexican civilians along with the bloody occupation of Mexico City. US-American ‚ÄúManifest Destiny,‚Äù the white nationalist myth that just this war of conquest, had no more moral or scientific legitimacy than the divine right of kings. After it lost more than 600,000 people in a Civil War resulting from Southern slaveholders‚Äô determination that the election of Abraham Lincoln posed an existential menace to their racist system, the U.S. let the South re-establish cotton slavery in new, post-chattel forms and launched the bloodiest industrial relations and labor history the world had ever seen. During the Great Labor Upheaval of 1877, US troops fresh from slaughtering Sioux children were deployed to crush immigrant workers who were designated as ‚Äúwhite savages‚Äù by the nation‚Äôs capitalist press. The largely immigrant-based workforce in the nation‚Äôs giant new ‚ÄúJungle‚Äù of deadly mines, mills, slaughterhouses, and factories was demonized as racially inferior and dangerous despite its European origins. For leading an Eight Hour movement and questioning the class rule of the new industrial and commercial bourgeoisie, Chicago social revolutionaries were executed in grisly short-rope fashion at the behest of the malignant merchandising mogul Marshal Field on November 11, 1887. Its industrial rise fueled by chattel and wage slavery, the great ‚Äúdemocratic‚Äù US-American ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù would soon expand its sphere-extending predation beyond its borders as it joined Europe in the imperialist division of the world. ‚ÄúExceptional‚Äù America enlisted its gendarmes in the murder of people its forces called ‚ÄúApaches‚Äù and ‚Äúniggers‚Äù in the Philippines, the Caribbean, and Central America. The next two centuries would see the United States directly and indirectly exterminate millions, mostly nonwhite (East Asians above all), in the names of ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù and ‚Äúdemocracy.‚Äù (For a summary of the carnage, which was continuous with the savagery of the initial continental sphere-extension, see my 2019 essay ‚ÄúThe World Will Not Mourn the End of U.S. Hegemony‚Äù). Who Controls the Present, Past, and Future This is some of the Trumpenvolk- ‚Äútriggering‚Äù history that Youngkinian Kens and Karens want (in the name of opposing Critical Race Theory [CRT]) their children to never learn. Beneath claims of wanting to protect children from trauma, the real purpose behind their determination to send real US-American history down Orwell‚Äôs memory hole is to make past crimes invisible so as better to repeat them. Neo-Confederate palingenetic ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù nationalism requires a whitewash of the past. By absurdly labelling real history CRT, paranoid-style Republifascist thought-controllers get to add a swipe at the intellectual class (always a key fascist target) and to suggest that they are sheltering youth from allegedly dominant ‚Äúcultural Marxism‚Äù and the global communist conspiracy. Never mind that liberal CRT discourse is limited to some law and graduate schools and academic journals. It isn‚Äôt actually ‚Äútaught‚Äù in US-American K-12 education. ‚ÄúWho controls the past,‚Äù Orwell‚Äôs mind-managing ruling Party tells its whitewashers in the dystopian novel 1984, ‚Äúcontrols the future. Who controls the present controls the past.‚Äù A Penny on the Dollar ‚ÄúDemocracy‚Äù Here we are 246 years after the Man on the Mountain took projection to new heights by calling Native Americans genocidal ‚Äúsavages‚Äù in a document that upheld ‚Äúliberty‚Äù and proclaimed that ‚Äúall men are created equal‚Äù even as it helped launch ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù to save North American slavery and ethnic cleansing from British suffocation. The vicious ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù lives on in a savagely unequal nation ‚Äì a world-leading mass incarceration, mass shooting, and covid death state where the top thousandth has as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent and where (in a remarkable reflection of slavery‚Äôs long reach) ‚Äúblack families have just one cent for every one dollar of accumulated wealth that white families have.‚Äù Yes, a ‚Äúpenny on the dollar‚Äù: you read that correctly. In other news, democracy is a distant dream in this de facto class dictatorship, where ‚Äúpolitics is the shadow cast on society by Big Business‚Äù (John Dewey) and majority public and progressive opinion is regularly cancelled by concentrated wealth and power. How could it not be? As the Supreme Court Justice Louis explained in 1940, ‚ÄúWe may have democracy, or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can‚Äôt have both.‚Äù The ‚Äúexceptional‚Äù US-American ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù ‚Äì exceptional among rich nations for the extremity of its poverty, inequality, ill-health, violence, segregation, incarceration, and more terrible to mention ‚Äì is caught up in a vicious oligarchic circle. The more harshly separate and unequal it becomes, the more plutocratic it gets; the more plutocratic it gets, the more harshly separate and unequal it becomes. This is Happening Now and Here Stephen Breyer‚Äôs ‚Äúgrandchildren and great grandchildren‚Äù will ‚Äúdetermine if the experiment still works‚Äù? Has Breyer read any of the relevant climate research on where the American and related global capitalist experiment is leading livable ecology quite soon? Environmental catastrophe, the natural outcome of capitalism‚Äôs anarchic addiction to endless growth and its lethal dependence on fossil fuels, is already underway. It‚Äôs happening to all of us and other living things now, with permafrost eruptions and ever more extreme weather events and epidemic drought taking place in the present moment. It‚Äôs not even clear how many future generations will survive. And capitalogenic ecocide is intimately related to the fascist threat here and abroad, as Andreas Malm has shown: it promises to bring about precisely the kinds of material societal crises that are the breeding grounds for fascist movements and the consolidation of fascism-as-force regimes. Fascism ‚Äúcan‚Äôt happen here.‚Äù Is that so? We have learned just how remarkably close the Orange Fascist Insect (the OFI) and his minions came to stealing the 2020 election. Whole slates of fake Electors were in place to hand contested states to Herr Trump if only Mike Pence had played along on January 6, 2021. Ex-military and ex-police paramilitary Oath Keepers were organized as Quick Reaction Forces positioned just off site ‚Äúto rapidly transport firearms and other weapons into Washington, D.C., in support of operations aimed at using force to stop the lawful transfer of presidential power‚Äù on the day of the attempted insurrection, More than one year later, January 6 is seen as inspiration and prologue ‚Äì a ‚Äúgreat dress rehearsal‚Äù (to steal Lenin‚Äôs description of Russia‚Äôs 1905 revolution) ‚Äì for millions of Americans and most of the nation‚Äôs elected Republicans see it in a favorable light or feel compelled to say they do. Donald Trump‚Äôs Hitlerian Big Lie of a Stolen Election is accepted by three in four Republicans. Nearly a third of whom would like to see Biden removed even before the next presidential election. Vast swaths of the white Amerikaner ‚Äúhomeland‚Äù believe that political violence is justified now to ‚Äúsave American culture‚Äù from the supposedly in-power ‚Äúradical Left.‚Äù The OFI is back on the hate rally campaign trail, promising (in essence) to pardon the OKs and other ‚Äúfascist marauders‚Äù (Congressman Jamie Raskin‚Äôs accurate phrase) who tried to subvert the peaceful, bourgeois-democratic transfer of power last year. (Trump apparently considered trying to offer a blanket pardon to the fascist rioters before he left office). He has made a Horst Wessel-like martyr out of the putschist military veteran Ashli Babbitt and is calling ‚Äúfor the biggest protests we‚Äôve ever had‚Äù to terrorize the Black female prosecutors who are investigating his crimes. Responding to the fascist leader‚Äôs call, the New York Times reports, ‚Äúthe prosecutor examining Mr. Trump‚Äôs efforts to overturn the election in Georgia immediately asked the F.B.I. to conduct a ‚Äòrisk assessment‚Äô of her building‚Äôs security.‚Äù Trump has recently endorsed Republifascist candidates in Michigan who advocate pulling the plugs on voting machines and coming to polling places ‚Äúlocked and loaded.‚Äù Kyle Rittenhouse, who became a right-wing celebrity by killing Black Lives Matter protesters with an illegally owned AR-15, will surely garner a post in a second Trump administration. As we learn that Trump tried to enlist the military in seizing voting machines in contested states after the 2020 election, the right wing Congresswoman Liz Cheney is right: ‚ÄúHe has acknowledged that he was trying to overturn the [2020] election. He is making it clear he would do this all again if given the chance.‚Äù As fascist mobs threaten election, school, cultural, and public health officials and workers (including now even school nurses and librarians!) across the country and as the right bans books that tell the truth about slavery, Native American genocide, sand the Nazi Holocaust, it seems likely that the Republifascist Party and its thugs will soon extinguish previously normative bourgeois electoral democracy and constitutional rule of law. ‚ÄúCivil war‚Äù and national ‚Äúimplosion‚Äù seems practically inevitable by numerous highly informed accounts. ‚ÄúThe much-proclaimed ‚Äòshining City on a Hill‚Äô,‚Äù Revolutionary Communist Party leader Bob Avakian rightly and wryly observes, ‚Äúis full of fascists.‚Äù And not just in rural backwoods and farm towns. The disproportionately petit-bourgeois people arrested for breaching and trashing the Capitol Complex on January 6, 2021, were mainly from ‚ÄúBlue America‚Äù suburbs where whites feel threatened by rising minority population. White members of fascist big city police unions can‚Äôt wait to pull their triggers on people who protest the Trump or DeSantis coup of 2024-25. The urban police forces that turn out en masse and to great media applause to honor their fallen comrades (like Ella French in Chicago last summer and Wilbert Mora and Jason Rivera in New York last week) are loaded with authoritarian personalities and neofascists. These ‚ÄúBlue MAGA‚Äù forces are ready to advance white nationalist lawlessness in the name of law and order. ‚ÄúWe have a little less than two years,‚Äù says Cooperation Jackson leader Kali Akuno, ‚Äúbefore the neo-Confederates and fascists install a reactionary dictatorship by the end of January 2025‚Äù ‚Äì no small matter in world history‚Äôs most powerful state. Not merely fascism but white power genocide is on the table in the world capital has made here and abroad. ‚ÄúThe Democrats need to stand up to this,‚Äù liberal friends tell me. Know any other good jokes? The Weimar Dems, Sheldon Wolin‚Äôs ‚Äúinauthentic opposition,‚Äù are hopelessly wedded to bourgeois democratic institutions that the Republifascists are smartly wiring never to ‚Äúwork‚Äù (Bryers‚Äôs word) again. They have little to offer beyond passive and hollow resistance. What an abject moral and generational surrender it is for an 83-year-old man still enjoying mad privilege at the pinnacle of the imperialist world system to say in the face of all this that the preservation of (so-called) democracy is a project for future generations ‚Äì and to cheerfully identify himself as an ‚Äúoptimist‚Äù and say he‚Äôs ‚Äúpretty sure‚Äù the (supposedly democratic) ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù will ‚Äúkeep working.‚Äù Really, judge? Breyer‚Äôs own absurdly powerful body (the Supreme Court) is set to re-impose the de facto female slavery of forced motherhood next June unless millions of US-Americans take to the streets and public squares to stand up for the basic human rights of women of childbearing age on March 8th ‚Äì International Woman‚Äôs Day. The Supremes seem likely also to significantly roll back local gun control in a bitter and divided nation saturated by weapons and plagued by a rolling epidemic of mass shootings. (The Armed American Madhouse already feels overdue for another one of its recurrent, tragically normalized and overdetermined mass casualty gun violence events, be inflicted by some angry white male ‚Äúradicalized‚Äù by right-wing media and by a disintegrating society that the anti-science pandemofascist right has helped turn into a Covid-19 Sanctuary State.) Imagine an Actual City on a Hill Speaking of history weighing ‚Äúlike a nightmare on the brains of the living,‚Äù I never cease to be impressed by the durable paranoid-style power of the fascistic neo-McCarthyism that lets the U.S. right call both the lying, neoliberal and warmongering Citigroup-Council on Foreign Relations party of the Clintons, Obama, and Biden and the US government ‚Äúradical Left,‚Äù ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù and even ‚ÄúMarxist.‚Äù The right Amerikaner noise and hate machine has millions of its unmasked followers believing that Joe Biden is ‚Äúthe Trojan Horse of socialism‚Äù and Kamala Harris takes instructions from the writings of Chairman Mao! Imagine if the USA had an actually radical Left government instead of a perverse Manchinian oligarchy well down the overlapping paths of fascisation and terminal environmental catastrophe. It‚Äôs a beautiful thing to envisions. In a revolutionary socialist North America, the leading financial, media, military, and energy corporations would be expropriated, nationalized, and thoroughly transformed in service to the common good. Fossil fuel extraction and burning would be massively curtailed as part of a rapid transition to renewable energy. Health care and not just health insurance would be nationalized, socialized, and otherwise transformed in service to the common good. The former US capitalist global empire would be thoroughly repurposed and radically transformed to spread global eco socialist transformation. Workers councils would be formed to coordinate with the revolutionary government to transform and repurpose economic activity in accord with eco socialist priorities. Parasitic bourgeois profits and anarchic capitalist ‚Äúmarket rule‚Äù and competition would cease to exist. The bourgeoisie as a class would be socially and historically abolished, its parties and media rendered harmless. Homelessness and poverty would be abolished. Fascists would face merciless liquidation. Racism and sexism would be designated as official societal enemies and crimes along with classism and ecocide. They would be deeply understood as matters of societal and institutional structure, policy, and practice and not merely as problems of subjective prejudice and belief. Women‚Äôs reproductive rights would be fully and immediately restored and guaranteed. Opponents of public health would face severe penalties and have zero right to spread murderous disinformation. Real and honest history would be rigorously taught from K through college and beyond, not to traumatize young people but to inspire them for the popular and democratic liberation of humanity, rescuing and properly telling real stories not only of oppression but also of people‚Äôs rebellion, and resistance. ‚ÄúTo Show That What Looks Like a Rational Conclusion is Mistaken‚Äù A rancid imperial superpower turned revolutionary state that did all that would be something like a shining city on a hill. Imagine. It could happen. I get my faith, very different from Bryer‚Äôs decrepit and fraudulent optimism, from the many conversations I have in which people agree ‚Äì despite all the capitalist and revanchist propaganda to which they are regularly subjected ‚Äì that this is a kind of future that would ‚Äúwork‚Äù and that is worth fighting for: revolutionary socialism. Is my radical conviction and even (admittedly guarded) optimism misplaced? Perhaps but that‚Äôs a question for ‚Äúabove it all‚Äù odds makers and intellectuals sitting on distant Mandarin perches that hold no interest for those of us who know that it‚Äôs now an existential choice between eco-socialism or potentially terminal catastrophe. Believing in the chances for revolution no matter what the betting odds is actually the rational choice. As Noam Chomsky has explained: ‚ÄòI think an objective observer, from Mars, let‚Äôs say, looking at the human species would conclude that they‚Äôre an evolutionary error‚Äîthat they‚Äôre designed in such a way that leads them to destroy themselves, probably much else along with them. That would be a rational conclusion. We can decide whether that conclusion is right or wrong. Fate: that choice is in our hands. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a question of optimism or pessimism. But do we make the choice, the effort, to show that what looks like a rational conclusion is nevertheless mistaken? That‚Äôs up to us.‚Äô It‚Äôs not about the crystal ball, comrades.

 cultural marxism and the frankfurt school of critical theory have infected the west. even though the soviet union fell apart thirty years ago, the memes they launched are still out there. 
 
 many of the students the frankfurt school taught became teachers and professors, who taught another batch of teachers and professors, and they‚Äôre now indoctrinating the entire west and its youth. some others became ensconced in the media or government positions. 
 
 this is what italian communist theoretician antonio gramsci called ‚Äúthe long march through the institutions.‚Äù only a fraction identifies with communism, but they still practice the party line even if few are aware of where their views originated. if you‚Äôve ever wondered where all of today‚Äôs social justice warriors came from, now you know the story.

You answered my first question with comparing wokeism to critical consciousness. I asked you what that was, and by responding with a cut and paste job, shows that you don't know what it was. Again, I wasn't upset with the answer, I was upset that you couldn't even write it yourself. You can call me obtuse all you want, but it doesn't make you less dishonest. Why answer questions that you have to cut and paste responses as opposed to answering directly. Sorry, you aren't getting out of this by saying I couldn't handle the answer. I commend you for coming back to respond, but the onus is on you. I asked YOU for the definition, not google or wikipedia or any other thing I could look up. ""Cultural marxist reinvention of the idea of class consciousness"" is the definition you gave, but then said ""Do you really need me to explain why the idea of class in marxism is a bad thing"" except the idea of cultural marxism isn't actually marxism for the most part. Here's what's said from the same website you got the critical consciousness quote: ""There are many difficulties with the term ‚Äúcultural Marxism.‚Äù For one thing, ‚Äúcultural Marxism‚Äù might imply to many hearers that ‚ÄúMarxism‚Äù is the relevant part of the phrase, which is somewhat inaccurate where both neo-Marxism and Critical Social Justice are concerned. Both of these ideologies are highly critical of Marxism, in fact, in their own fashion, and the latter (at least) is barely interested in economic class and is distinctly bourgeois itself."" - newdiscourses(.)com Cultural marxism is used as a technique more than being what critical consciousness stands for. Marxism is a distinct view on economics and cultural marxism is a way to use the views against culture, history, etc. But there are those who say the sum goal is to move toward communism (scary word, I know) which again, isn't actually marxism. From what I gathered from what I've read, that's not the goal with critical consciousness. Critical consciousness, the way that I see it, is the lens we put on to analyze history, literature, cultural movements, etc. The first word in the phrase in ""critical"" and it means just that, to use criticism to as a way to analyze a subject. Will it lead to activism? Yes, that does seem to be the natural evolution of the idea. It would make sense that it would. So, now, my question to you is why is it wrong to look at history in these terms, in the concept of systematic racism and oppression within our history? Did oppression on minority groups happen? What was the cause? And why is it wrong to ask those questions? What is wrong (and this is a cut and paste as it's a direct quote from what you copied and pasted) with rejecting questions like ‚Äúdid racism occur?‚Äù and replacing them with ‚Äúhow has racism manifested in this situation?‚Äù Here are some other views of critical consciousness as lens to interpret history: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih(.)gov/pmc/articles/PMC5892452/ https://kappanonline(.)org/critical-consciousness-key-student-achievement/ This one shows how critical consciousness can be used to as ""a gateway to academic motivation and achievement for marginalized students."" http://achievethecore(.)org/peersandpedagogy/what-is-critical-consciousness/ I know I wrote a lot here to read. I'm new to the concept and this is really my own personal interpretation of the subject matter. Critical consciousness is a very dense way to examine our history. If you are truly honest with your discourse, you'll read what I wrote. But I doubt you can ""handle the answer."" :)",look didnt answered first question comparing wokeism critical consciousness asked responding cut paste job shows dont know wasnt upset answer upset couldnt even write call obtuse want doesnt make less dishonest answer questions cut paste responses opposed answering directly sorry arent getting saying couldnt handle answer commend coming back respond onus asked definition google wikipedia thing could look cultural marxist reinvention idea class consciousness definition gave said really need explain idea class marxism bad thing except idea cultural marxism isnt actually marxism part heres whats said website got critical consciousness quote many difficulties term ‚äúcultural marxism‚äù one thing ‚äúcultural marxism‚äù might imply many hearers ‚äúmarxism‚äù relevant part phrase somewhat inaccurate neomarxism critical social justice concerned ideologies highly critical marxism fact fashion latter least barely interested economic class distinctly bourgeois newdiscoursescom cultural marxism used technique critical consciousness stands marxism distinct view economics cultural marxism way use views culture history etc say sum goal move toward communism scary word know isnt actually marxism gathered ive read thats goal critical consciousness critical consciousness way see lens put analyze history literature cultural movements etc first word phrase critical means use criticism way analyze subject lead activism yes seem natural evolution idea would make sense would question wrong look history terms concept systematic racism oppression within history oppression minority groups happen cause wrong ask questions wrong cut paste direct quote copied pasted rejecting questions like ‚äúdid racism occur‚äù replacing ‚äúhow racism manifested situation‚äù views critical consciousness lens interpret history httpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlespmc httpskappanonlineorgcriticalconsciousnesskeystudentachievement one shows critical consciousness used gateway academic motivation achievement marginalized students httpachievethecoreorgpeersandpedagogywhatiscriticalconsciousness know wrote lot read im new concept really personal interpretation subject matter critical consciousness dense way examine history truly honest discourse youll read wrote doubt handle answer,0,0,5,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

COMMUNIST JEWS - POLITICAL INSIGHTS ORGANIZED JEWRY: DESTROYERS OF THE WESTERN CIVILIZATION ‚Äì Marcus Eli Ravage, Jewish author, quote from January 1928 issue of Century Magazine ‚ÄúWe Jews, we, the destroyers, will remain the destroyers for ever. Nothing that you will do will meet our needs and demands. We will for ever destroy because we need a world of our own, a God-world, which it is not in your nature to build.‚Äù ‚Äì Maurice Samuels, Jewish author, quote from You Gentiles. For centuries, organized Jewry has been at the forefront in the efforts to subvert, corrupt, and eventually destroy traditional Western civilization and all that it stands for. Henry Makow, in a review of E. Michael Jones‚Äô The Jewish Revolutionary Spirit and Its Impact on World History, described the role played by organized Jewry to accomplish this goal as ‚Äúsubversive in the profoundest sense, overturning the Will of God, ‚ÄúLogos,‚Äù Christ‚Äôs Gospel of Love, the inherent Design and Purpose of Creation, hijacking mankind and arresting its development according to Cabalistic and Talmudic dictates.‚Äù Through their control of the media and Hollywood, their influence in popular culture and the arts, various intellectual and ‚Äúsocial justice‚Äù movements including cultural Marxism, feminism, and radical homosexuality, the promotion of pornography and sexual degeneracy, and advocacy of mass immigration and ‚Äúmulticulturalism‚Äù in Western European and European-derived countries (the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand), organized Jewry has certainly targeted tradition Western civilization for destruction. These destabilization techniques represent a Jewish plot to culturally, spiritually, politically, and economically corrupt, pollute, and destroy European culture primarily, and all decent, honorable indigenous cultures generally. Organized international Jewry must be viewed as a hostile elite determined to destroy Western civilization. In the Preface of Culture of Critique, Dr. Kevin MacDonald breaks this down quite well: CofC describes how Jewish intellectuals initiated and advanced a number of important intellectual and political movements during the 20th century. I argue that these movements are attempts to alter Western societies in a manner that would neutralize or end anti-Semitism and enhance the prospects for Jewish group continuity either in an overt or in a semi-cryptic manner. ...",personally verifiable truth selfrealization piece excerpted psychologically n morally wrong kids youth n personal breakdown past literally deliberate agenda thru intentional decades date ask communist jews political insights organized jewry destroyers western civilization ‚äì marcus eli ravage jewish author quote january issue century magazine ‚äúwe jews destroyers remain destroyers ever nothing meet needs demands ever destroy need world godworld nature build‚äù ‚äì maurice samuels jewish author quote gentiles centuries organized jewry forefront efforts subvert corrupt eventually destroy traditional western civilization stands henry makow review e michael jones‚äô jewish revolutionary spirit impact world history described role played organized jewry accomplish goal ‚äúsubversive profoundest sense overturning god ‚äúlogos‚äù christ‚äôs gospel love inherent design purpose creation hijacking mankind arresting development according cabalistic talmudic dictates‚äù control media hollywood influence popular culture arts various intellectual ‚äúsocial justice‚äù movements including cultural marxism feminism radical homosexuality promotion pornography sexual degeneracy advocacy mass immigration ‚äúmulticulturalism‚äù western european europeanderived countries united states canada australia new zealand organized jewry certainly targeted tradition western civilization destruction destabilization techniques represent jewish plot culturally spiritually politically economically corrupt pollute destroy european culture primarily decent honorable indigenous cultures generally organized international jewry must viewed hostile elite determined destroy western civilization preface culture critique dr kevin macdonald breaks quite well cofc describes jewish intellectuals initiated advanced number important intellectual political movements th century argue movements attempts alter western societies manner would neutralize end antisemitism enhance prospects jewish group continuity either overt semicryptic manner,21,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0

They know that abortion is good for business. More women going for abortion -> less women being mothers -> more women as workers -> wage remains low. Wokeism is ultimately a cost-cutting measure.

The notion of communities holding property in common and the ideal of those extending to industry predated Marx. The conspiracy of equals in France aimed for what was essentially communism. 
 
 What Marx envisioned and attempted to quantify in his writings was the class warfare between the Proletariat and the Bourgeoisie in an oppressor/oppressed dichotomy. To my knowledge this black and white view of society in addition to his materialistic and ""scientific"" view of history is what was different from what you see in previous works. The latter is simply wrong and the former is a recipe for disaster that directly contributed to atrocities such as the liquidation of the Russian kulaks. 
 
 I don't think it's disingenuous to describe him as I do because it's accurate. He's not directly responsible anymore than the Volkishe Movement writers were directly responsible for the Holocaust. Unfortunately, their writings did directly contribute and attempting to pretend they didn't would rightly earn derision. 
 
 Going back to the term cultural Marxism, its use by bad people doesn't change that it's accurate in what Peterson and many others are trying to describe. It's like me saying that someone using terms common among the far left makes them a communist. The term is also fairly common now to the point where assigning it's very use to holding a certain worldview is not only inaccurate but seemingly an attempt to demonize opposition.",well first wouldnt even say marx invented communism anymore adam smith invented capitalism notion communities holding property common ideal extending industry predated marx conspiracy equals france aimed essentially communism marx envisioned attempted quantify writings class warfare proletariat bourgeoisie oppressoroppressed dichotomy knowledge black white view society addition materialistic scientific view history different see previous works latter simply wrong former recipe disaster directly contributed atrocities liquidation russian kulaks dont think disingenuous describe accurate hes directly responsible anymore volkishe movement writers directly responsible holocaust unfortunately writings directly contribute attempting pretend didnt would rightly earn derision going back term cultural marxism use bad people doesnt change accurate peterson many others trying describe like saying someone using terms common among far left makes communist term also fairly common point assigning use holding certain worldview inaccurate seemingly attempt demonize opposition,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0

I go with straight authoritarianism.
 
 Click to expand... 
 I am not sure what this means. I take this to mean you denounce all authoritarianism. But this is an error. Authoritarianism is not de facto good or bad. Rather, it all depends on who or what has ascended to power and wields authority.
 If you think democratic norms still apply, or will apply as things get worse, you are stark raving mad. I wonder if you know that even America has its own authoritarin past--with Abraham Linconl. He suspended habeaus corpus and declared martial law, not just in the South but in the entire union. When the Civil War broke out, he violated the rights of those who sympathized with the Confederacy, most particularly in Maryland. Secessionists in Maryland were jailed, brutalized with beatings and sometimes even killed. If he had not done that, Maryland might well have seceded and than the Confderacy would have captured Washington, making the Union look like the rogue state. 
 Wormy said:  Gas the Jews. Gas the left. Gas anyone deemed sexually deviant. White homeland for whites, other colored home lands for colored people.
 
 Click to expand... Very few if anyone advocates for what is described in the first three sentences. 
 Beyond that, why should whites not enjoy homogenos countries? I bet your pussy does not get all sore at the prospect of a homogenous Japan, or an indepedent, homogenous TIbet. But yes, Germany should be German, the French national team should field actual Frenchmen, London should be populated with English, Welsh, Scottish, and Irish, ie actual Britons. The balkanization, fracturing of society not just in the US but in all European countries and its diaspora will not end well. It will not work, because man is innately and indelibly tribalist. And current norms deem that it is fine for every single racial group to do so, except of course whites. Fuck that. 
 Wormy said:  Mainly that Jews are not, in fact, responsible for my problems in life and all of society's problems and becoming all white won't magically fix everything. That's the big one. There's smaller ones too, if you're interested.

 If you like mythology you might like looking at Joseph Campbell‚Äôs work directly. Humans do use stories as frameworks and to create a sense of self, there‚Äôs lots of work out there on that and narrative therapy is a legit form of treatment. That‚Äôs something that I simultaneously liked about Peterson (his self-narration thing he was selling relatively cheaply), and I also thought exemplified his snakiness (he presented it as something new, as his idea, and produced some really bogus research to sell his specific version of it). 
 
 I also think he‚Äôs a terrible clinical psychologist, because of his emphasis on psychoanalysis. That‚Äôs not reputable or evidence based. He faced multiple law suits from clients for negligence, sexual assault, and for breach of privacy. In his 12 Rules book he speaks about the utility of hitting children (this is opposite to the evidence), and when he refers to other treatments he really doesn‚Äôt represent them accurately. 
 
 It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt like Jung, I have a few of his books on my shelf. It‚Äôs not science or treatment in anyway, shape, or form. If anyone thinks Jungian myth/mysticism is to be used for treatment of anything then they are being negligent. He‚Äôs a footnote in history and to be treated as philosophy/fictional literature if anything. 
 
 His clean your room advice is presented as being about taking responsibility, that‚Äôs fine in itself. What follows from that is Jordan disparaging activism, and telling people to fix themselves before they even attempt to fix society. That‚Äôs a false dichotomy, you absolutely can and should do both at the same time. It‚Äôs a highly individualistic and antisocial message. That attitude is not good for mental health. That fits right with his capitalism admiration, his Republican/conservative audience. It‚Äôs holding onto the status quo, it‚Äôs saving tradition. It‚Äôs disparagement of environmentalists, people campaigning for minority groups, people striving for social progress. He‚Äôs no different than the Protestants five hundred years ago who believed that the natural position for females and slaves was underneath, and any alteration to that natural hierarchy would upset Yahweh and destroy our objective values. When he talks about cultural Marxism he is using Nazi language. Peterson is not a nice man at all and there‚Äôs a reason he attracts a certain crowd in general (I‚Äôm also aware there‚Äôs good decent people like yourself who are taking the good and leaving the rest, when it comes to JP fans I think you‚Äôre very much in the minority sadly), watch everything he accuses others of and then look at his actions‚Ä¶ he pays lip service to get himself off the hook then just asks the question.

The fundamental principles of dream interpretation used by Freud are already present in the Talmud.Freud said that in psychoanalysis, he was analyzing a human being just as the Jews had analyzed the Torah for centuries.Freud was a member of the Masonic sect of B‚Äônai B‚Äôrith, a branch of Freemasonry reserved exclusively for Jews. From 1900 to 1902, Freud participated as a founder in the creation of the second Lodge of B‚Äônai B‚Äôrith of Vienna, the Harmony Lodge.Yosef Yerushalmi, who was the Salo Wittmayer Baron Professor of Jewish History, Culture and Society at Columbia University, from 1980 to 2008 wrote that Freud‚Äôs psychoanalysis was a Jewish science:‚ÄúThe obvious racialism and the clear statement of Jewish ethical, spiritual, and intellectual superiority contained in Freud‚Äôs last work, Moses and Monotheism, must be seen not as an aberration of Freud‚Äôs thinking but as central to his attitudes‚Ä¶I noted that prior to the rise of Nazism an important set of Jewish intellectuals had a strong racial sense of Jewish peoplehood and felt racial estrangement from gentiles; they also made statements that can only be interpreted as indicating a sense of Jewish racial superiority. The psychoanalytic movement was an important example of these tendencies.

I've not read through all of the comments - hope I can get back with some time to read through. But, for brevity, *I'd like to share a few thoughts on the back of reading some of the discussion*. How to frame properly this OP and the issue it addresses? 
 
 
 
 *One, hate the sin and love the sinner*. While I believe that same sex attraction is a distortion, a result of a spiritual corruption in human nature, that doesn't mean I should not love and value God's children who are subject to that corruption. 
 
 
 
 And, *when I say corruption, I say this as a remark on the general state of humanity, not the individual*. There are those who experience same-sex attraction, and who do not want it. There are those who experience it as a result of abuse in their lives. There are many causes, and it's not simply as if the individual who experiences same sex attraction is responsible for that condition. 
 
 
 
 Yes, there are those who give themselves over to that attraction, by which I mean, they indulge in it, and increase it, and behave in degenerate ways. I'm not talking about the same-sex attraction individual who lives a monogamous life and tries to be morally upstanding in their personal integrity. That doesn't make homosexual behavior right, but then, who is perfect in their behavior? So, hate (reject) the sin, but love the sinner. 
 
 
 
 *My personal belief is that the problem of same-sex attraction derives ultimately from the influence of fallen angels over humanity* (see scriptural reference #1 below ), and will ultimately be resolved on a collective level when humanity is restored to our original relationship with God, and thus also with the angels, after the return of Christ. 
 
 
 
 *Two, the LGBTQI agenda has nothing to do with loving the sinner. It is a satanic agenda, using sexual immorality to corrupt human beings and short-circuit our capacity to unite with God*. God cannot accept and interact with sinful nature, and sexual immorality lies at the very foundation of the human sin. 
 
 
 
 *Sexual union between his son and daughter was the greatest blessing God wanted to bestow on his children*. By being united in ecstatic, true unselfish love, God's purpose was for one son and one daughter to be bound together in that experience (Scrip. Ref #2). Not only that, when a man and woman become completely one in true love, they fully resemble the union of God's own nature, and so that's where humans were to be bonded to God, as well. Love, binding God his son and his daughter, all as the starting point for a new life, and new child of God. Sacred beyond words. 
 
 
 
 Think about it. Why is the experience of sexual union between a man and a woman in love so often expressed in the Bible in this two metaphors: One - ""knowing"" and two - eating a fruit? 
 
 
 
 Is it a coincidence that the fall of Adam and Eve is described as ""the eating of a fruit"" and the fruit in question is ""the fruit of knowledge""? Not a coincidence. 
 
 
 
 *The LGBTQI agenda does what every other agenda by the Devil, by the corrupt and evil elite, does: it seduces those it pretends to serve, and aid, but without any intent to truly serve, or aid*. When the goal is achieved, that pretence is thrown off, and the instrument(s) of that objective are cast aside. This is the point the OP is experiencing, but many of us knew a long time ago that this would be the case. 
 
 
 
 *In true satanic fashion, many compassionate people have been seduced by the LGBTQI agenda*: those who could see the pain and suffering that same-sex attracted people experienced and took pity on their fellow man and woman; those who are same-sex attracted, and who try to find some reconciliation of the inner conflict or conflict with society resulting from their inner experience, and who looked to being accepted or treated as valuable (as all God's children are) as a way to resolve any difficulty or inner conflict. 
 
 
 
 All people with integrity try to find some way to resolve the issues that same-sex attraction and homosexual behavior, etc, give rise to. We might say live and let live; I'll respect your right to live how you choose as long as you respect mine. We might say, I need to declare that your behavior is sinful, regardless of how this makes you feel. And so forth. 
 
 
 
 As I stated above, personally, I believe this issue will only be resolved over time as collectively, humanity is restored to our original relationship with the Creator. 
 
 
 
 *But until then, **it's critical to distinguish between** the experiences and lives of individuals that experience same-sex attraction on the one hand, and the political, ideological and satanic agenda that the LGBTQI actually is on the other*. We can practice love and acceptance towards the former, but we cannot practice acceptance or love towards the latter. Why? 
 
 
 
 *Because it is NOT a movement to help, aid or comfort those individuals*. *It's a movement designed in hell, pursued politically and culturally, to twist the power of culture and government to destroy the family, the true relationship between men and women, and the human capacity to connect with God through aligning with God's commandments, and it doesn;t care if it destroys anyone, including same-sex attracted or homosexuals/lesbians, even trans, along the way*. 
 
 
 
 The OP doesn't quite realize this second point, and simply now thinks, they went too far. Those who know the origin and intended destination of this 'movement of the Left' know very clearly, that they were ALWAYS going to push it to it's ultimate destination. 
 
 
 
 But the more that those who live with Same-Sex Attraction and/or who practice homosexuality, realize this, and the more that the seduced ""compassionate"" people who were sucked in by the Lie understand this, the better off they and the rest of us will be. 
 
 
 
 Sexual immorality is the oldest sin, and the hardest to root out. But nothing can stop what is coming.

Your post may not depend on the modern use of the word (debatable) but it's at the very least benefiting from that common confusion. It also lazily dismisses a hundred plus years of both actual and contemprorary critical left-wing though levied against the (and I'm using the modern meaning here) dictatorships setp up in marxism's name.

It always goes like this: they regurgitate the laziest propaganda on a subject there is, and then they do heavy posturing in their counter-reply, using words like ammulets, summoning, *saying* an argument is bad but not *showing* how it is, accusing of some nebulous ""bias"", lacking context, ""obscurantism"", or whatever other rationalization/accusation.

Protocols of the Illuminated Suns of the Golden Dawn https://i-uv.com/protocols-of-the-illuminated-suns-of-the-golden-dawn/ Protocol 1: Gaslighting the Media 1.) The ‚ÄòRussian-collusion‚Äô investigation is the quintessential example of this principle of not only allowing but encouraging the media to spin their delusional narrative. The deep state is tempted into to believing that their narrative will be used to undermine popular opinion of the president in preparation for his impeachment (plan A). If impeachment fails, the groundwork will have been laid for public acceptance, if not relief, at his assassination (plan B). This delusion about their Russian-collusion conspiracy theory narrative is to be encouraged whenever possible. 2.) The primary purpose of gaslighting the media is distraction. The time the CIA Mockingbird apparatchiks spends trying to convince the public of their Russian-collusion conspiracy theory is time the Alliance can use to collect evidence and build air tight cases for the upcoming military tribunals. 3.) The secondary purpose of gaslighting the media is to act as time-delayed controlled demolition of the mainstream media‚Äôs reputation. The longer the delusional narrative is allowed to run, the greater the eventual damage to the MSM‚Äôs credibility. Every effort must be made to allow the Trump team to appear suspicious and continue feeding the conspiracy theory‚Äôs suspicions, while not providing anything tangible. Provide so much ‚Äòsmoke‚Äô that belief in the existence of a ‚Äòfire‚Äô becomes exceedingly easy. 4.) The tertiary purpose of gaslighting the media is to create in the agents of the deep state, and their liberal stages, a false sense of security. The goal is to foster a surreal dissociative sense of cognitive dissonance, an uneasy feeling that is relieved by concluding that Trump is simply guilty and stupid. The alternative conclusion being that the entire liberal media establishment has been chasing a giant fiction, while Trump prepares his retaliation; the more improbable and terrifying this possibility, the more cognitive dissonance it will create. 5.) The false belief is so tempting that the deep state FBI and CIA agents will march deeper into their treasonous plot to frame and impeach POTUS, further documenting their own crimes, while providing more time for the white hats to investigate their crimes. Mueller leads the big guns of the deep state fixers on a slow and steady march directly into the jaws of military justice. 6.) The longer the gaslighting continues, the longer Trump has to lift the country up. He has time to remove the restraints and undo the acts of sabotage done to America by the globalists, thus allowing the country to thrive‚Äîmaking America great again. The longer the gaslighting goes on, the greater America becomes. This drives an ever-widening gap between the delusional MSM narrative and the lived reality of Americans on Main Street. 7.) The genius of this protocol is the fact that it allows a gradual awakening of the public to the lies of the mainstream media. This steady shift continues until the public is overwhelmingly aware of the delusional plot to unseat POTUS. When the time is right, and the Russian-collusion farce has been thoroughly exhausted, the Alliance will begin to drop the bombshell disclosures (HRC videos, etc.). Protocol 2: Secure Victory Before Firing a Shot 1.) Victory must be secured before the first shot is fired. Indeed, there will be no shots necessary, for such absolute victory will have been secured in the shadows. 2.) While publicly feigning inaction and incompetence to help gaslight the media, in actuality great action will be taken, covertly. Sealed indictments will be piled steadily, month after month, until they reach such absurdly high numbers that their sheer number will cause reports of them to be disbelieved and dismissed as ‚Äòfake news.‚Äô 3.) The diligence and discipline of the investigations will be so intense and contrast so starkly with the perceived baffoonery of the White House, that its existence will be disbelieved. The fog of the gaslighting campaign will serve as a thick veil. While leaks of covert operations are prevented, they will be allowed and subtly enabled in the White House. The more leaks coming out of the White House the better. 4.) Deep state agents will be commandeered, using their ‚Äòcontrol files‚Äô and the prospect of a plea deal as leverage with which to puppeteer them. These agents will leak information with such brazen abandon that it will lull the deep state into false security, while perpetuating the false image of a chaotic, disorganized, inefficient, and deeply undermined White House. 5.) Strength must be dressed up to look like weakness. Enemies who have been neutralized must be made instead to appear active. Over time the enemies will be directed to act in increasingly absurd and unbelievable ways. Their leaks and lies will be made increasingly brazen and obvious, until it finally dawns on everyone that the whole thing is theater. They will then begin to fathom the truth of what has really been happening behind the scenes, which is so starkly different from what has been portrayed in the theatrical version that it will take time to fully fathom and believe. Protocol 3: Weaponize the Light (Disclosure) 1.) The most powerful weapon of the Alliance is the Truth. The extent of the deep state‚Äôs crimes and evil depravity is matched only by the extent of the NSA and CIA surveillance capacity. Every single crime is documented, every criminal association mapped out, every conversation recorded, every bank transfer documented, we see everything. 2.) The Light is so overwhelmingly powerful that the chief concern is no longer victory. Victory was assured the moment Trump was inaugurated. The chief concern is maintaining the stability of the system, while the cabal is quietly neutralized. 3.) The Light is so powerful that it cannot be released too quickly, or else it will cause unnecessary shock, panic, and chaos. It must therefore be released in steady measured doses, and only after the gaslighting of the media has been allowed to run as long as possible. When the public begins to realize who the real criminals are, within the FBI, DoJ, and DNC, and begin to demand justice‚Äîand when the military tribunals have finished their initial fact finding mission and the stage has been set‚Äîonly then will the files and videos begin to be dropped. 4.) Lies take time to be spun and believed, while the truth strikes like lightning. The Light, therefore, has no reason to rush. The CIA Mockingbird delusion machine is allowed to take their best shot, day after day, night after night, for as long as they can keep it up. The disclosure waits for the gaslighting of the media to run its full course, allowing it to overextend and exhaust itself, before the major drops begin. This is akin to a superior boxer allowing his opponent to tire himself out in the first rounds. 5.) Once begun, disclosure will proceed as rapidly as the public is capable of processing the information. The severity of the crimes in the unsealed indictments will proceed from the most simple and obvious infractions (such as mishandling classified documents and perjury) on to the increasingly serious and audacious crimes (election fraud, racketeering, conspiracy to commit murder, and high treason). In this way the public is given time to come to terms with the criminality in a succession of revelations. Baby steps, to the gallows. Protocol 4: Cut Off the Cabal‚Äôs Money 1.) The flow of money to the cabal is to be severed in multiple ways during the calm before the storm. 2.) Child trafficking networks are to be busted, freeing the child slaves, arresting the procurers and traffickers. These busts are used to gather evidence and build cases against the Satanic pedophile blackmail slave networks, while also cutting off one of the greatest sources of illicit funding for the cabal‚Äôs operations. 3.) Drug processing operations in Afghanistan are to be bombed and raided, while major trafficking by CIA cargo planes are to be quietly disrupted. 4.) Organ trafficking rings are to be busted, as well, as every illicit source of funding is cut. This funding attrition is used to pressure the minions and mercenaries to flip on their control structures, having been softened by the end of easy money and faced with long prison terms‚Äîthey naturally spill their guts. The great thing about opportunistic psychopaths is that they haven‚Äôt the slightest qualms about flipping, when placed under pressure. The evidence and testimony collected from these foot soldiers are collected into massive air-tight cases against the cabal higher-ups. This sets the stage for the military tribunals. 5.) The underground bunkers and jungle retreats are raided, to end their black market activities as well as to deny safe havens for the cabal leadership. 6.) The second to last strike on the cabal‚Äôs finances will be to sign an executive order declaring a national emergency regarding human rights abuses and corruption, and giving the Treasury Department the authority to freeze and seize the bank accounts of anyone involved in such crimes. This will neutralize the majority of the cabal‚Äôs wealth, and force them into capitulation. 7.) The final strike on the cabal‚Äôs finances will be the crash of the financial markets. The financial contagion will start with Deutsche Bank and the derivatives market, possibly triggered by the Chinese petroyuan launch, but will quickly spread to every market. Safeguards will be triggered and the markets will be frozen in their free fall. This event will be used as the trigger for the martial law takedown of the cabal and the unsealing of the sealed indictments (18,500+ filed since October of last year). ========================================== Protocols of the Illuminated Suns of the Golden Dawn (Part 1) .

The power of the cabal is founded on dark occultism: the act of occulting or ‚Äòveiling‚Äô the most fundamental truths about the true nature of reality‚Äîespecially from their own members‚Äîin order to enslave, manipulate, and exploit every person and every nation on Earth. The power of the cabal is absolutely dependent on keeping these truths secret. These Revelations unveil the most devastating truths, for they are the most vital secrets on which the dark occult cabal has been built. Light has become weaponized, and these Revelations are the most potent weapons of light in the arsenal of the Illuminated Suns of the Golden Dawn‚Äîsave, of course, from the specific incriminating evidence in the blackmail ‚Äòcontrol files‚Äô of each individual minion, and all the additional evidence gathered by the NSA and DIA. The cabal cannot survive the full revelation of these truths to the masses. Paradoxically, the greatest deceptions of all have been perpetrated on the core members of the cabal itself. Some of the most absolutely enslaved, manipulated, and exploited people on Earth are actually the Satanic pedo-blackmail slaves of the ‚Äòpedocracy,‚Äô except of course for the children they are forced to rape, torture, and sacrifice to perpetuate their mutual blackmail enslavement. We the Illuminated Suns of the Golden Dawn are ‚Äòlight supremacists.‚Äô Our victory is inevitable. The following Revelations are the most powerful weapons in our arsenal of light. . Revelation 1: The ‚ÄòUnited States‚Äô is a Corporation, Subverted by Globalist SES, Fed, and SERCO 1.) The deep state and shadow government use shadowy organizations such as the Senior Executive Services (SES) in order to systematically subvert, paralyze, and parasitize the constitutional republic. Indoctrinated corporatist stooges in the SES enact the bidding of their globalists masters, often completely oblivious to the fact that the SES is not simply a novel pay structure, but a system of covert globalist control‚Äîa deep state‚Äîspecifically designed to more efficiently subvert the US government to the will of the shadow government of the cabal. 2.) Since 1871 the ‚ÄòUnited States‚Äô is technically a corporation, masquerading as a constitutional republic. This fact has been effectively occulted not only from the vast majority of Americans, but from even the vast majority of people who work in and for the US government. 3.) The original ‚Äòlaw of the land‚Äô of our constitutional republic has been subverted in practice by maritime admiralty law, or the ‚Äòlaw of the sea.‚Äô Why use the law of the sea to govern the land? Because it is more favorable to corporations, and enables the creation of legal fictions, like United States Inc., to masquerade as if it were our government. Even US citizens are identified as corporations, legal fictions or ‚Äòstraw men‚Äô (known for their depiction in all caps, e.g. JOHN DOE) and treated as such when interacting with the criminal justice system or the US corporation. The whole system is ‚Äòphony,‚Äô in a literal sense. The legal structure of admiralty law was invented in Venice, by the Venetians, who are descendants of the Phoenicians (Canaanites) and are the reason we have the word ‚Äòphony‚Äô in the first place. It is quite literally a phony legal system, used by globalists to subvert our constitutional republic through lies, dark occult mind control, and deceptive maritime admiralty lawfare. 4.) The Federal Reserve is another foreign owned globalist corporation, one that has unconstitutionally usurped the mechanism of money creation from the US Treasury. (This process was briefly described in Protocol 6.3 of the Protocols of the Illuminated Suns of the Golden Dawn.) 5.) The Fed has replaced real US currency with fraudulent Federal Reserve ‚Äònotes,‚Äô which are actually ‚Äòdebt instruments‚Äô‚ÄîIOUs. Most people don‚Äôt realize it, but it is technically impossible to pay off a debt, because we don‚Äôt have real money with which to do so. Instead, we can only ‚Äòdischarge‚Äô a debt. In other words, we are able to shift the burden of a debt off of ourselves by matching the amount of the bill we owe with the same amount of ‚Äòbills‚Äô in our wallet, owed to us by the government. We discharge the debt from ourselves to the hopelessly indebted corporate fiction masquerading as our republic, which claims US citizens (straw men corporations) as the ‚Äòchattel‚Äô (propery) pledged as collateral for the national debt. The whole scheme is so absurdly evil, so audaciously criminal, that most sane Americans would find it extremely difficult to believe. 6.) Other subversive globalist corporations include SERCO, a monstrous agent of the Crown. SERCO acts as an information backbone for globalist intelligence agencies, transportation systems, intellectual property (patent) bureaucracy, and even prison systems. It is known as the largest company you‚Äôve never heard of. SERCO is one of the corporate structures through which innovations can be stolen, and troublesome ‚Äòdisruptive‚Äô inventors identified, and targeted. It is also the means through which the influence and control of the shadow government is quietly coordinated, and our national sovereignty is systematically subverted by agents of the Crown. 7.) More insidious than even the occult corporate systems of the shadow government, however, are the dark occult methods of mind control, blackmail, and slavery used by the cabal to achieve absolute unquestioning obedience and total secrecy of their most vital operatives within all of these corporate systems. It‚Äôs not just the structurally subversive SES and SERCO‚Äîit‚Äôs also the key positions of power within the FBI, DoJ, DoD, CIA, Congress, central banks, big pharma, big chem, big oil, and the mainstream media‚Äîto name just a few. 8.) The institutions of the cabal‚Äôs shadow government are evil, and it is vitally important to identify them by name‚Äîsuch as the SES and SERCO. Let‚Äôs bring them out from the shadows into the light! These rats must be shown for what they are. However, we will never be able to fully grapple with them until we understand WHY they are evil, and HOW evil itself exists. It is necessary to understand what evil actually is, on a practical level. Evil is an ancient Babylonian technology of entrapment, mind control, blackmail, and slavery‚Äîwhich enables the erection of a veil of lies. The most basic truths about our ‚Äòrepublic,‚Äô our ‚Äòmoney,‚Äô and our ‚Äòjustice‚Äô system have all been occulted from us by blackmail slaves of the cabal. Until we realize how these people were selected, entrapped, and enslaved into the dark occult cabal of the Satanic New World Order‚Äîand how they were coerced into committing crimes and telling the most audacious of lies‚Äîit will be difficult to even comprehend how such huge lies, and heinous crimes, were even possible. . Revelation 2: The Truth About Fame, Power, and the Cabal Trap 1.) The most ambitious and talented people are only allowed to rise so far in positions of power and influence before they inevitably hit the ‚Äòglass ceiling.‚Äô It is fashionable these days to blame racism, sexism, and the ‚Äòpatriarchy‚Äô for this obvious glass ceiling, but the truth is that it is just as real for the smartest and most supposedly ‚Äòprivileged‚Äô of white men as anyone else. 2.) The glass ceiling is not about bigotry against any race or gender, nor is it a matter of intelligence and skill. The barrier is ultimately psycho-spiritual. The reason the barrier exists is the significant and ever-increasing liability that the cabal faces, for its power is founded upon its ability to keep certain truths occulted behind a wall of absolute secrecy. The greater the corruption of the cabal becomes‚Äîand the more technology increases the ability of influential people to spread information ever more instantly, to ever more people‚Äîthe more absolute their methods of control must become. Sexual blackmail and ritual sacrifice are among the most effective methods the cabal uses, backed up with the threat of murder and/or harm to one‚Äôs family. 3.) This is one of the most guarded secrets of the cabal: the reality of the ‚Äòsoul trap,‚Äô or ‚ÄòFaustian bargain,‚Äô with regard to positions of significant power and influence. Everyone in the cabal has ‚Äòsold their soul,‚Äô meaning every person with access to significant influence and control has either sold themselves into blackmail slavery, or been entrapped into it; this is the price one has to pay to play the game. Often this happens through entrapment, usually after the person has been carefully selected for the ideal attributes: attractive narcissistic atheist psychopaths. 4.) Almost everyone who actually knows the truth about the soul trap are those who have fallen prey to it, and thus sworn to secrecy under the threat of death, not to mention the blackmail and credible threat of harm to their family members. If someone can talk about it, they probably haven‚Äôt faced it; if they have faced it, they likely can‚Äôt talk about it. The select few with the spiritual strength to reject the ‚Äòoffer‚Äô are either killed, or their lives so thoroughly destroyed that they might as well be dead. 5.) Ironically, most of the high IQ narcissistic psychopaths who sell their souls to the cabal are atheists. It‚Äôs easiest to convince someone to sell their soul, if they don‚Äôt even believe they have one in the first place. But the irony gets even worse. With progressive enslavement and coercion many in positions of significant power within the cabal are forced to participate in increasingly horrific Satanic rituals. The psychic trauma of participating in these rituals produces mind altering chemicals such as endorphins and adrenochrome. In addition to this effect, they supplement with even more powerful mind-altering substances which have built up in even higher quantities in the blood of their victims, which they are forced to drink. The combined effect creates a state of dissociative hallucination, during which the participant comes into direct contact with extra-dimensional beings, aka demons. It is at this point that the poor Satanic slave realizes that the spirit world is real; they were an atheist when they sold their soul, and when they finally discovered the true existence of demons (and angels), evil (and divinity)‚Äîit was too late. Or so they have been made to believe. These people need to be freed from their slavery, they need spiritual salvation and rehabilitation/re-education. . Revelation 3: The True Meaning of ‚ÄòIlluminati,‚Äô and the Truth About Social Darwinism and Royal ‚ÄòBloodlines‚Äô 1.) One of the greatest and most powerful secrets of all‚Äîwhich is hidden from the majority of cabal members‚Äîis the supremacy of light, and the inevitable triumph of light over darkness. The primacy of this secret is the reason for it not only being hidden in plain sight (one of their favorite tactics) but being hidden in the absolute pinnacle of plain sight: ‚ÄòLucifer‚Äô (lit. ‚Äòlight bearer‚Äô) and ‚ÄòIlluminati‚Äô both encode this most essential and dangerous truth: light supremacy is inevitable. Truth and God will inevitably triumph over lies and evil. That which the dark occultists fear most, their greatest secret, they chose to hide from each other in the most obvious plain sight‚Äîthe very semantic pinnacle of the ‚ÄòLuciferian‚Äô ‚ÄòIlluminati.‚Äô 2.) The most convincing lie, with which the inevitable supremacy of light has been occulted from the minions of the cabal, is the concept of ‚Äòsocial Darwinism.‚Äô Dark occultists fancying themselves ‚Äòsocial Darwinists‚Äô have mistakenly claimed that psychopathy is the most advanced/evolved trait a human can have. This claim is based on the objective fact that the genetic trait of psychopathy (the inability to feel empathy) has provided the ‚Äòbloodline families‚Äô (genetically psychopathic families) of the cabal an obvious advantage over normal humans. These congenitally psychopathic bloodlines have long ruled Europe as the ‚ÄòRoyal‚Äô families. 3.) This genetically inherited trait of ‚Äòcold bloodedness‚Äô has allowed the bloodline family members to use Satanic ritual abuse, rape, torture, human sacrifice, and blackmail slavery to wield totalitarian control over each other, and the shadow government and deep state‚Äîfor many centuries of successful rule. Such evil methods of control are only possible for psychopaths, for normal humans would not be able to do such things, let alone carry on such traditions for centuries. The idea that psychopathy is an evolutionarily superior trait is a convincing lie, for it has worked so well for so many centuries. 4.) Psychopaths ruled during the Dark Age, when secrecy was the most effective tool for welding control. The most occulted secret is that they are destined to yield, however, to intuitive empaths and illuminated geniuses in the Golden Age, when information and surveillance inevitably becomes so ubiquitous that secrecy becomes impossible. 5.) Psychopathy did enable the creation of a global shadow government through blackmail control networks, and other immoral means, which could only be effectively accomplished by psychopaths. This is similar to the use of scaffolding to build an arch. The arch could only be built by first erecting the scaffold structure around it. Psychopathy is the building material of the shadow government. During the whole construction process, the scaffolding comes first, and the entire structure is held together by the scaffolding. In the end, however, once the keystone of the arch is in place, the scaffolding is no longer needed. 6.) To argue that psychopathy is the most evolutionarily advanced trait is like arguing that scaffolding is the most advanced aspect of an arch under construction. After all, the scaffolding rose first, and has held the whole arch together during the entire construction process. Does that not mean it is the most advanced and long lasting aspect of the structure? That is exactly what a builder would tell pieces of scaffolding, if they were conscious, in order to trick them into being used to build the arch. Social Darwinism was the lie told to the psychopaths of the shadow government, because the occulted truth has always been that the supremacy of light can only be delayed for so long, and the most advanced trait of humanity is our selfless ability to lay down our lives for the greater good. Empathy and love are the most advanced and enduring traits of humanity. Callousness and fear did have a big head start, and long enjoyed total dominion, but in the end love‚Äôs triumph is inevitable. The Golden Dawn is inevitable. 7.) Another genetic trait exists, which also plays a significant role in the evolution of man and the dawning of the Golden Age. It has been the subject of both significant research by the CIA and DIA, as well as a prolonged and concerted smear campaign. The media has so effectively ridiculed the subject that it still hasn‚Äôt been mentioned in this paragraph. Just as ‚ÄòUFOs‚Äô and ‚Äòconspiracy theories‚Äô have been effectively ridiculed and maligned by the mainstream media, so have ‚Äòpsychics‚Äô and ‚Äòtelepathy.‚Äô What is only now being revealed to the public, however, is that the CIA and DIA (& KGB) not only researched psi abilities, such as remote viewing, etc. but they actively employed them. Eventually the research was taken underground, into unacknowledged special access programs (USAPs), where it has continued to be developed. The combination of genetic modifications of augmented soldiers, or ‚Äòaugments,‚Äô whose natural telepathic ability was genetically enhanced, with a further prosthetic enhancement of this ability via sophisticated electromagnetic technology‚Äîhas given military intelligence the ability to read people‚Äôs minds, and communicate via remote influence or telepathy. 8.) Dark occultists have long sought to identify and enslave psychics, to prevent them from working against them. At the same time, they would try to get the rest of the population to ignore and suppress their natural psi abilities by pushing the belief on the general public that such abilities were either superstitious nonsense, or the work of the devil. As the general population begins to rediscover these abilities, however, and as secret military intelligence units enhance and utilize these abilities, the ability to keep secrets is ending, and dawn is breaking. 9.) The most powerful and occulted truth is that the dark night of humanity‚Äôs soul eventually and inevitably yields to the Illumination of the Golden Dawn. . Revelation 4: The Truth About ‚ÄòMoral Relativism,‚Äô Natural Law, and Karma 1.) Moral relativism is an intellectually dishonest theory foisted on oblivious atheists on liberal campuses by the brainwashed useful idiots of the cultural Marxists. The dark occultists esoteric philosophy is theistic and absolute, but the exoteric liberal philosophy of cultural Marxism, which they promote to the profane masses of debt-slaves they indoctrinate, is founded on atheism and moral relativism. 2.) Mid-level Satanic blackmail slaves are duped by the belief that the fact that they are the order givers rather than order followers, somehow they believe this insulates their moral culpability. In actuality, it just insulates their affective reaction, by being physically removed from the actual physical act of the crimes they order. 3.) The occulted reality of the situation is that order followers, enforcers, police, military, mercenaries‚Äîor as the dark occultists like to call them, their ‚Äòdogs‚Äô‚Äîare to them as muscles cells are to brain cells in the human body. To claim innocence for immoral orders is like claiming innocence for something your finger muscles did, because you self-identify as your brain. The occulted reality is that the karma of the order lies as much with the creator of the order as with the ones who carried it out. One does not need to actually have blood on one‚Äôs hands, to have blood on one‚Äôs hands. 4.) The acute awareness of natural moral law, and awareness of guilt for immoral behavior, is the reason for multiple elaborate attempts by Satanists and dark occultists to dilute, ignore, absolve, and somehow justify their guilt and karmic debt. The process is actually just a slippery slope of ever deeper enslavement by the cabal: 4.1) Vilification of ignorance: The first of the LaVeyan Satanic sins is ‚Äòstupidity.‚Äô Since being stupid is a sin, this supposedly justifies immoral behaviors toward stupid people. The irony of this ‚Äòsin‚Äô is that IQ is almost entirely determined by genetics (with a maximum of only +/-10 IQ point shift due to circumstances). So, stupid people can‚Äôt help but be stupid. To think someone could be guilty of the supposed ‚Äòsin‚Äô of stupidity, when they were just born that way, is like thinking a cat can be guilty of not being a dog. The irony is compounded by the fact that not realizing this fact, is itself a form of stupidity. So, people who excuse their own guilt for abusing stupid people simply because the people they abuse are stupid, are themselves guilty of stupidity. This ‚Äòsin‚Äô concept was created purely as a tool of self-deception, to avoid feeling guilty for objectively immoral behavior. As if the irony wasn‚Äôt thick enough, ‚Äòself-deceit‚Äô is the 4th of the LaVeyan sins. ‚ÄòHerd conformity‚Äô is the 5th sin, which is inevitably violated every time one participates in a Satanic ritual. 4.2) Exploitation of guilt: Th",illuminated suns golden dawn protocols revelations audiobook protocols illuminated suns golden dawn httpsyoutuberqjeuzkw people weaponized truth

 Whatever you want to do at home is of no concern to me. But a belief that gender roles play an important role in really any social behavior outside of the home, such as determining someone's skill as a worker, would not be supported by any scientific research.

Feminism, CRT, cultural Marxism: all the same shit - traditional way is bad bad so bad. A whole new language has arisen to support this. Words like Racist, Misogynist, Homophobe and the like have arisen to demonize ideas which predate the wheel. Ideas likepeople prefer the company of their own kindmen and women are differentgay people can undermine social cohesionwere understood for 100,000 years and practiced by every society until critical theory.So when you investigate that, you see that the modern left is in fact Semitic in origin, both philosophically (uniting the ideas of Freud and Marx is the essence of critical theory) and practically: Weil and Horkheimer, and later Alinsky, Steinem, Friedan, Julius Rosenwald, Soros etc. The leaders of the left have always been Jews. Politically, the loudest cheerleaders for the left are often Jews: Sanders, Schumer and in the past, Mr. Immigration himself, Jacob Javits. One need only look at the impeachment(s) of POTUS Trump to see how Jews feel about MAGA. In addition to Schumer, the leaders included Schiff, Nadler and Raskin....and of course Vindman. FYI Raskin's wife is a far left activist (Surprise!) that Sen Manchin is keeping away from the Fed.We see then that:the left is based on critical theory, which is revealed by its name: a critique of traditional social structures. (The Frankfurt school was a social theory school)The creators of this. philosophy and its leaders thereafter are mostly jews, certainly Jews are disproprotionally represented. This tracks with data showing Jews vote 8/10 (D).The only uncertainty is Rep Greene's opinions, which we can't be sure of. But many Christians seem to think Jews and Christians are all one big family and we'll all get on the same page when Jesus comes back. While this may or may not happen, Jews and Christians are far less spiritually aligned than Sunnis and Shiites, and how are they doing?So yes, Rep Greene might do well to investigate these things further and gain a deeper understanding of the actual battle lines, not the D-R theater which is the source of her popularity.",cant speak commenter seems pretty clear modern left based nothing implementing teachings critical theory imported us max horkheimer feminism crt cultural marxism shit traditional way bad bad bad whole new language arisen support words like racist misogynist homophobe like arisen demonize ideas predate wheel ideas likepeople prefer company kindmen women differentgay people undermine social cohesionwere understood years practiced every society critical theoryso investigate see modern left fact semitic origin philosophically uniting ideas freud marx essence critical theory practically weil horkheimer later alinsky steinem friedan julius rosenwald soros etc leaders left always jews politically loudest cheerleaders left often jews sanders schumer past mr immigration jacob javits one need look impeachments potus trump see jews feel maga addition schumer leaders included schiff nadler raskinand course vindman fyi raskins wife far left activist surprise sen manchin keeping away fedwe see thatthe left based critical theory revealed name critique traditional social structures frankfurt school social theory schoolthe creators philosophy leaders thereafter mostly jews certainly jews disproprotionally represented tracks data showing jews vote dthe uncertainty rep greenes opinions cant sure many christians seem think jews christians one big family well get page jesus comes back may may happen jews christians far less spiritually aligned sunnis shiites doingso yes rep greene might well investigate things gain deeper understanding actual battle lines dr theater source popularity,16,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

Cultural Marxism,2022-11-04,18:40:43,Thuletide,Telegram,https://t.me/thuletide/3894,"The point of this post was very simple: People should not blame the old order for the actions of those who overthrew it. As usual, the ""Third Positionists"" totally missed the point. These self-identified Socialists have spent the last few years claiming (without any empirical evidence) that Cultural Marxism does not exist and that we instead live under ""Cultural (Classical) Liberalism"" or ""Cultural Capitalism."" ""Leftists and non-Whites are not demolishing the West and peddling Globalism, it's those dang Anglo-American Liberal Free Market Capitalists!"" Before WW2 (or at least until around the Great Depression, when Socialists gained more influence), the ideology of the Anglosphere was unabashed White (Anglo-Saxon) supremacism, eugenics, scientific racism, segregation, anti-immigration and nativism, Christianity, strong families, and traditional culture. You'd have to be completely insane to believe that the system we live under today is remotely comparable in terms of economics or ideology. We have more regulations than ever before, big government-backed monopolies, private-public partnerships, bloated welfare states, massive taxes, massive global wealth redistribution from Whites to non-Whites, and Socialist (or ""Social Democratic"") parties dominating governments since the end of WW2. Even the so-called ""Capitalist"" elites of the WEF & Co. express their desire to abolish Capitalism. Furthermore, all of the theory that underpins so-called ""Cultural Liberalism"" was cooked up by Marxist academics and their students, not the corporate boardrooms of Fortune 500 companies. Noel Ignatiev, Franz Boas, Theo Adorno, Herbert Marcuse, Kim Crenshaw, Angela Davis, etc. are Socialist Third Worldists, not Classical Liberals. Plus, as I've repeatedly pointed out, postwar Globalist ideology has deep roots in the Socialist movement, dating back to the earliest Utopians and Radicals (I'll write an article on this topic soon). Modern ""Capitalists"" (corporations, businesses, etc.) parrot Cultural Marxist (""Woke"") ideals for a few reasons: 1. They're forced to do so by Civil Rights laws (enacted by Socialists & Social Democrat governments in the 60s/70s). 2. They're threatened by ""cancel culture"" enforced by Leftist media hegemony and NGOs like the ADL. 3. Leftist activists aggressively colonized corporations as part of their Long March Through The Institutions of Power. 4. Globalist elites (who take ideological cues from Leftist academia and from being predominantly ethnically Jewish) have bought up and monopolized corporations. 5. Too Big to Fail companies can push unprofitable ideological nonsense because they're supported by the state. 6. Companies are kept in line by private finance pressure, e.g. BlackRock's ESG which is a corporate Cultural Marxist social credit score. Corporations aren't special unique entities controlled by magical abstract economic wizardry, but nodes of power (like government, media, academia, or judiciary) that can be captured or dominated by ideologically-motivated parties and individuals. Finally, if Anglo-Saxon Classical Liberalism inevitably leads to Globalism and transgender toddlers due to some inherent ""structural flaw,"" then what does that imply for imperial monarchist countries, like Germany, Russia, and China? They succumbed to Leftism faster than any Anglo-Saxon state. Spain was a Fascist/monarchist country up until the late 70s but is now as Globalist as they come. Socialist ""Third Positionists"" want you to blame ""Anglo-American Liberal Capitalists"" for all of our woes because, in typical Leftist fashion, they are trying to sell a poison (Socialist Third Worldism) as its own antidote. They want the technocracy, the UBI, the bloated welfare state, to save all of the ""oppressed"" brown people around the world, and so on. This is why they downplayed or defended the COVID tyranny, claimed that Agenda 21 is irrelevant, tried to rehabilitate Socialist states (e.g. Yugoslavia), and idolize countries like Russia and China, both of which are anti-White, multiethnic/racial technocracies.",point post simple people blame old order actions overthrew usual third positionists totally missed point selfidentified socialists spent last years claiming without empirical evidence cultural marxism exist instead live cultural classical liberalism cultural capitalism leftists nonwhites demolishing west peddling globalism dang angloamerican liberal free market capitalists ww least around great depression socialists gained influence ideology anglosphere unabashed white anglosaxon supremacism eugenics scientific racism segregation antiimmigration nativism christianity strong families traditional culture youd completely insane believe system live today remotely comparable terms economics ideology regulations ever big governmentbacked monopolies privatepublic partnerships bloated welfare states massive taxes massive global wealth redistribution whites nonwhites socialist social democratic parties dominating governments since end ww even socalled capitalist elites wef co express desire abolish capitalism furthermore theory underpins socalled cultural liberalism cooked marxist academics students corporate boardrooms fortune companies noel ignatiev franz boas theo adorno herbert marcuse kim crenshaw angela davis etc socialist third worldists classical liberals plus ive repeatedly pointed postwar globalist ideology deep roots socialist movement dating back earliest utopians radicals ill write article topic soon modern capitalists corporations businesses etc parrot cultural marxist woke ideals reasons theyre forced civil rights laws enacted socialists social democrat governments ss theyre threatened cancel culture enforced leftist media hegemony ngos like adl leftist activists aggressively colonized corporations part long march institutions power globalist elites take ideological cues leftist academia predominantly ethnically jewish bought monopolized corporations big fail companies push unprofitable ideological nonsense theyre supported state companies kept line private finance pressure eg blackrocks esg corporate cultural marxist social credit score corporations arent special unique entities controlled magical abstract economic wizardry nodes power like government media academia judiciary captured dominated ideologicallymotivated parties individuals finally anglosaxon classical liberalism inevitably leads globalism transgender toddlers due inherent structural flaw imply imperial monarchist countries like germany russia china succumbed leftism faster anglosaxon state spain fascistmonarchist country late globalist come socialist third positionists want blame angloamerican liberal capitalists woes typical leftist fashion trying sell poison socialist third worldism antidote want technocracy ubi bloated welfare state save oppressed brown people around world downplayed defended covid tyranny claimed agenda irrelevant tried rehabilitate socialist states eg yugoslavia idolize countries like russia china antiwhite multiethnicracial technocracies,2,0,1,5,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

""Protection"" in this racket means survival but not life, equity but not fairness, financial handouts but not prosperity, and politically correct narratives but no truth. This last point deserves emphasis. The powers that be ‚Äî the central bankers, global financial elites, corporate propagandists, and political aristocrats ‚Äî have given up on any notion of truth. They neither pursue it objectively nor desire to discover it for philosophical or spiritual elevation. Truth, to them, is too dangerous because it cannot be controlled by men with power. So they murdered it and molded a monster out of clay they affectionately call their narrative. Then, having no respect for the dead or remorse for their deed, they chose to disguise their monstrous narratives with masks made from truth's likeness. Science is venerated as the apotheosis of objectivity, even as those with power dictate what official science can say, expunging dissenting scientific opinions from the public domain by either starving grant-dependent scientists into submission or outright censoring their work. Like a tribe of Paleolithic hunter-gatherers dancing around a fire and praying to the moon, the powers that be pretend to be obedient and humble disciples of science's objective purity by chanting together, ""We must follow the science wherever it goes."" In practice, however, they know exactly where the science will go because they are the ones paying for it to dance to the beat they alone provide. If science is controlled by a global oligarchy using it for personal wealth and power, then ""trust the science"" really means ""trust the authoritarians."" It really is that simple. https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2022/01/crumbling_narratives_leave_the_ruling_class_with_everything_to_fear.html",crumbling narratives leave ruling class everything fear fta heres covid authoritarians want seek use pandemics wars uncontrolled immigration doomsday climate predictions woke cultural marxism keep people constant state fear divided among willing hand freedoms evaporative promises protection protection racket means survival life equity fairness financial handouts prosperity politically correct narratives truth last point deserves emphasis powers ‚äî central bankers global financial elites corporate propagandists political aristocrats ‚äî given notion truth neither pursue objectively desire discover philosophical spiritual elevation truth dangerous controlled men power murdered molded monster clay affectionately call narrative respect dead remorse deed chose disguise monstrous narratives masks made truths likeness science venerated apotheosis objectivity even power dictate official science say expunging dissenting scientific opinions public domain either starving grantdependent scientists submission outright censoring work like tribe paleolithic huntergatherers dancing around fire praying moon powers pretend obedient humble disciples sciences objective purity chanting together must follow science wherever goes practice however know exactly science go ones paying dance beat alone provide science controlled global oligarchy using personal wealth power trust science really means trust authoritarians really simple httpswwwamericanthinkercomarticlescrumblingnarrativesleavetherulingclasswitheverythingtofearhtml,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

 Although these are dark days in America, as it looks as though the nation is collapsing into the dust, such as the politicizing of the DOJ/FBI against ones opponents as in the Russia Hoax and now this, or against parents at school board meetings---and two sets of Laws in America---one for the elites and one for the rest of us....America is actually NOT about to fall because like France we too have a destiny with Prophecy.
 ---As France was on the brink of collapse to the Anglo-Burgundian forces, and mired in a civil war within between the Armagnac Party and the Burgundian Party---a peasant girl from out of Lorraine emerged on scene pressed on by voices and visits from ""dead saints"".
 I believe that as she entered the room where the Dauphin (Charles VII) was in disguise, all Heaven was watching as the game was afoot in this GREAT CONTROVERSY to derail France from it's destiny with Prophecy (both the French Revolution and 1798). As she picked out the disguised leader and convinced him to follow her how do you think it would eventually have ended for the Frankish state after victories in Orleans and Patay? Q: Do you really think a peasant girl knew what she was doing at the head of armies in grisly, bloody Medieval combat? A: Of course not.
 Likely the Prince of Persia was setting the French up for final defeat--where after a couple of victories he would lead her & her followers to ultimate defeat....but the forces of Prince Michael had other plans to thwart these by turning the Maid of Orleans into a rallying cry for France and ultimate victory.
 ---Q: Now how does the appearance of Collapsing America, under the weight of corrupt, incompetent, radical politicians and Cultural Marxism play out in the Great Controversy? A: We'll soon likely see but for now this grossly incompetent radical (mostly leftist) politics has rotted the world to it's core--from self inflicted economic harm (Greren Agenda--see Ghana, Sri Lanka, Netherlands, etc.) to lack of trust in institutions (see Russia Hoax, COVID Narrative, etc.) as well as cultural rot (see the advancement of the LGBT agenda in the public arena) and let's not forget the path towards turning into FREEDOMLESS DEMOCRACIES in the west (see Canada, Britain, etc. on free speech and freedom of Religion). ---One can only imagine what the whirlwind will bring and what that solution will involve. Maybe cat calls for a 5 year truce for world peace like the President of Mexico just called for or Maybe a Laudato Si' style solution/revolution for Mother earth and her inhabitants? Or a Babel-like city in Saudi Arabia called Neom and the Line set to open in 2024. Or Green Lockdowns on Sunday modeled after COVID Lockdowns? Or a digital programmable currency in the name of combating crime (you know like the crimewave instigated by our politicians) and combating Inflation (you know like the Inflation caused by our politicians) .... time will tell.....

Still more see it as the logical successor to 1990s-type race, class, and gender obsessions‚Äîalbeit with a shriller and more dangerous Jacobin, Soviet, and Maoist twist. Wokeism‚Äôs hysteria also invites comparisons to the Salem witch trials and McCarthyism. But few have described wokeism as the cruel creed that it is.

Feminism, CRT, cultural Marxism: all the same shit - traditional way is bad bad so bad. A whole new language has arisen to support this. Words like Racist, Misogynist, Homophobe and the like have arisen to demonize ideas which predate the wheel. Ideas likepeople prefer the company of their own kindmen and women are differentgay people can undermine social cohesionwere understood for 100,000 years and practiced by every society until critical theory.So when you investigate that, you see that the modern left is in fact Semitic in origin, both philosophically (uniting the ideas of Freud and Marx is the essence of critical theory) and practically: Weil and Horkheimer, and later Alinsky, Steinem, Friedan, Julius Rosenwald, Soros etc. The leaders of the left have always been Jews. Politically, the loudest cheerleaders for the left are often Jews: Sanders, Schumer and in the past, Mr. Immigration himself, Jacob Javits. One need only look at the impeachment(s) of POTUS Trump to see how Jews feel about MAGA. In addition to Schumer, the leaders included Schiff, Nadler and Raskin....and of course Vindman. FYI Raskin's wife is a far left activist (Surprise!) that Sen Manchin is keeping away from the Fed.We see then that:the left is based on critical theory, which is revealed by its name: a critique of traditional social structures. (The Frankfurt school was a social theory school)The creators of this. philosophy and its leaders thereafter are mostly jews, certainly Jews are disproprotionally represented. This tracks with data showing Jews vote 8/10 (D).The only uncertainty is Rep Greene's opinions, which we can't be sure of. But many Christians seem to think Jews and Christians are all one big family and we'll all get on the same page when Jesus comes back. While this may or may not happen, Jews and Christians are far less spiritually aligned than Sunnis and Shiites, and how are they doing?So yes, Rep Greene might do well to investigate these things further and gain a deeper understanding of the actual battle lines, not the D-R theater which is the source of her popularity.",cant speak commenter seems pretty clear modern left based nothing implementing teachings critical theory imported us max horkheimer feminism crt cultural marxism shit traditional way bad bad bad whole new language arisen support words like racist misogynist homophobe like arisen demonize ideas predate wheel ideas likepeople prefer company kindmen women differentgay people undermine social cohesionwere understood years practiced every society critical theoryso investigate see modern left fact semitic origin philosophically uniting ideas freud marx essence critical theory practically weil horkheimer later alinsky steinem friedan julius rosenwald soros etc leaders left always jews politically loudest cheerleaders left often jews sanders schumer past mr immigration jacob javits one need look impeachments potus trump see jews feel maga addition schumer leaders included schiff nadler raskinand course vindman fyi raskins wife far left activist surprise sen manchin keeping away fedwe see thatthe left based critical theory revealed name critique traditional social structures frankfurt school social theory schoolthe creators philosophy leaders thereafter mostly jews certainly jews disproprotionally represented tracks data showing jews vote dthe uncertainty rep greenes opinions cant sure many christians seem think jews christians one big family well get page jesus comes back may may happen jews christians far less spiritually aligned sunnis shiites doingso yes rep greene might well investigate things gain deeper understanding actual battle lines dr theater source popularity,16,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

 Of course the Frankfurt School turned that initial foray years early, into a precise art form, where Indoctrination replaced Education, in a very, VERY BIG WAY!

The problem is, however, that cultural marxism is far more insidious and cancerous than even regular old fashioned marxism, because it can NEVER stop.The second you start treating people differently based on their identity characteristics, you open the door for everyone else to bitch and complain and moan about needing special treatment as well. And the fact that they gave it to one, means they have to give it to others else their power is not legitimate.So what happens?First you might start with groups based on gender or race. It might just be men and women being divided, and then white/black/asian/latino etc.,Next, you have to represent the people of different nationalities and sexual orientations, and gender ""identities"". So it goes from black people being represented, to now needing to represent black females.But wait, there's more! What happens when black females get represented? Well, of course, the black female muslim transgender disabled lesbians need to be represented.What happens when they get represented though? The same thing of all races must be represented. Then it starts going down further rabbit holes, like hair color, height, personality type, people who prefer cats to dogs, people who don't like hotsauce, cancer survivors, people with teeth or people who have no teeth.That's the direction you start going down, which means you will not stop until you hit the ultimate minority - the individual. At some point, the only way you can be inclusive and represent everyone on the SCOTUS is to literally let everybody on the planet be a member.We can see, obviously, how insane and retarded this shit is. It leads nowhere good.Which is precisely why identity should NEVER be allowed to be a factor in determining peoples opportunities. We should NEVER even try to ""represent"" people like that.The job should solely be based on whether you are the best candidate. In the case of scotus, if you will be able to uphold the constitution the best.Being a black transracial latinx transgender disabled lesbian dog owning cancer survivor with a beard, has literally no bearing on whether you can uphold the constitution.

Cultural Marxism,2022-02-20,3:50:01,ayosayonayokayo,Patriots,https://patriots.win/p/141reqSZEZ/isnt-it-interesting-how-fascism-/,"This is not fascism, this is cultural marxism. If the allied soldiers could see what their supposed victory brought upon their nations, they would not have fought.Hitlers last speech:German Volksgenossen! National Socialists!Twelve years ago, when, as the leader of the strongest party I was entrusted by the deceased Reich President, Paul von Hindenburg, with the office of Chancellor, Germany found herself faced with the same situation internally as the one that today faces it externally.The forces of economic destruction and annihilation of the Versailles dictate led to a situation that had gradually become a permanent one-namely, the existence of almost 7,000,000 unemployed, 7,000,000 part-time workers, a destroyed farmers class, a ruined industry and a commerce that had become correspondingly prostrate.The German ports were nothing but ship cemeteries. The financial situation of the country threatened at any moment to lead to a collapse not only of the state but also of the provinces and of the communities. The decisive thing, however, was this: Behind this methodical destruction of Germany's economy, there stood the specter of Asiatic bolshevism. It was there then, just as much as it is there today.In the years before our assumption of power the bourgeois world was incapable of opposing this development effectively on a small scale, just as it is incapable of doing so today on a large scale. Even after the collapse of 1918 this bourgeois world had failed to realize that an old world was vanishing and a new one being born and that there is no use in supporting and thus artificially maintaining what has been found to be decayed and rotten, but that something healthy must be substituted for it. A social structure that had become obsolete had cracked and every attempt to maintain it was bound to fail.It was no different today on a large scale, when the bourgeois states are doomed and when only clearly defined and ideologically consolidated national communities can survive the most difficult crisis Europe has seen in many centuries.We were granted only six years of peace after jan 30, 1933. During these six years tremendous feats were achieved, and even greater ones were planned, so many and such huge ones that they caused envy among our democratic impotent neighbors. But this was decisive: That we succeeded during these six years, with superhuman exertions, to restore the German nation militarily - that is, to imbue it with the spirit of resistance and self-assertion rather than to equip it with a material war potential.The horrid fate that is now taking shape in the east and that exterminates hundreds of thousands in the villages and the market places, in the country and in the cities will be warded off in the end and mastered by us, with the utmost exertion and despite all setbacks and hard trials. But if this is possible at all, it is only because a change has taken place in the German people since 1933.It is hardly necessary to argue with those eternal blockheads who maintain that an unarmed Germany would, owing to its impotence, not have become the victim of this jewish international world plot. Since when does the fox not kill the defenseless goose just because the goose is not aggressive by nature, and since when does a wolf become a pacifist because sheep do not wear armor? If there are still bourgeois states who earnestly believe this, that only proves how necessary it was to do away with an era that by its educational system managed to cultivate and maintain such notions, nay, even granted them political influence.The fight against this jewish asiatic bolshevism had been raging long before National Socialism came into power. The only reason why it had not already overrun Europe during the years 1919-20 was that it was then itself too weak and too poorly armed. It's attempt to eliminate Poland was not abandoned because of its compassion for the Poland of that time but only because the lost battle before Warsaw. It's intention to annihilate Hungary was not discarded because they changed their minds, but because bolshevist power could not be maintained militarily. Nor was the attempt to smash Germany given up because this achievement was not desired but because it proved impossible to overcome the natural resistance stamina of our people.Thereupon Judaism began systematically to undermine our nation from within, and it found its best ally in those narrow-minded bourgeois who would not recognize that the era of a bourgeois world is ended and will never again return, that the epoch of unbridled economic liberalism has outlived itself and can only lead to its self-destruction and, above all, that the great tasks of our time can be mastered only under an authoritarian coordination of natural strength, based on the law of same rights for all and, thence, of same duties. On the other hand, the fulfillment of the same duties must necessarily entail an equality of rights. Thus National Socialism, in the midst of gigantic economic, social and cultural reconstruction work has also educationally given to the German people that armor without which no military values can be created.The power of resistance of our nation has grown so tremendously since Jan 30, 1933, that it can no longer be compared with the earlier epoch, this power of resistance is the surest guarantor of the final victory. If Europe today finds itself the victim of a serious illness, then the affected countries will either have to overcome it by summoning their entire and utmost power of resistance, or they will be doomed. Yet the convalescent and survivor overcomes the climax of such an illness only in a crisis, a crisis that utterly weakens him, but in spite of all, it is all the more our immutable will not to shrink from anything in this struggle to rescue our people from this most gruesome fate of all time, and to obey steadfastly and the commandment of the preservation of our nation.The fact that this defense is fraught with incalculable misery, suffering and hardships makes us even more attached this nation. But it also gives us that hard will needed to fulfill our duty even in the most critical struggle; that is, not only to fulfill our duty toward the decent, noble Germans, but also our duty toward those few men without honor who divorce themselves from their people. In this fateful battle there is therefore for us but one command: He who fights honorably can thus save his own life and the lives of his loved ones. But he who, because of cowardice or lack of character, turns his back on the nation, will under any circumstance die a shameful death.That National Socialism succeeded in awakening and strengthening this spirit in our German people is a great achievement. Only when this mighty international drama will have died away and the bells of peace are ringing will realization come of what the German people owes to this spiritual rebirth: No less than its existence in this world.Only a few months and weeks ago allied statements openly outlined the German fate. Thereupon they were warned by some newspapers to be more intelligent and rather to promise something, even though nobody intended to keep this promise later. As a relentless National Socialist and fighter for my people, I now wish to assure these statesmen once and for all that every attempt at influence National Socialist Germany through slogans, lies and distortions presupposes a simple-mindedness unknown to the Germany of today.The fact that political activities and lies are inextricably linked in a democracy is of no consequence. Decisive is that every promise given by these statements to a people is today quite meaningless, because they are not in a position ever to fulfill any such promise. This is as if one sheep promised another sheep to protect it against a tiger.I herewith repeat my prophecy:England will not only not be in a position to control bolshevism but her development will unavoidably evolve more and more toward the symptoms of this destructive disease. The democracies are unable to rid themselves now of the forces they summoned from the steppes of asia. All the small European nations, who capitulated, confident of allied assurances, are facing complete annihilation. It is entirely uninteresting whether this fate will befall them a little earlier or later; what counts is its implacability.The kremlin jews are motivated only by tactical considerations; whether in one case they act with immediate brutality or, in another case, with some reticence, the result will always be the same. Germany, however, shall never suffer this fate. The guarantor thereof is the victory achieve twelve years ago within our country. Whatever our enemies may come up with, whatever sufferings they may cause on our German cities, on German landscapes, and above all, on our people, all that cannot bear any comparison with the irreparable misery, the tragedy that would befall us if the plutocratic-bolshevik conspiracy were victorious.Therefore, it is all the more necessary on this twelfth anniversary of the rise to power to strengthen heart more than ever before and to harden oneself in the sacred resolve to take up arms, no-matter where and under what circumstances, until final victory crowns our efforts.On this day I do not want to leave any doubt about something else. Against an entire hostile world I once chose my road, according to my inner call, and strode it, as an unknown and nameless man, to final success; often they reported I was dead and always they wished I were, but in the end I remained victor in spite of all.My life today is with an equal exclusiveness determined by the duties incumbent on me. Combined, they are but one: To work for my people and to fight for it. Only He can relieve me of this duty who called me to it. It was Providence's hands to eliminate me through the bomb that exploded only one and a half meters from me on July 20, and thereby terminate my life's work. In the years to come I shall continue on this road, uncompromisingly safeguarding my people's interests, oblivious to all misery and danger, and filled with the holy conviction that God the Almighty will not abandon him who wanted nothing other all his life than to spare his people from a fate it had never deserved neither by virtue of its number nor by way of its importance.I therefore now appeal to the entire German people and to my old fellow-fighters and to all the soldiers to gird themselves with a yet greater, harder spirit of resistance, until we can again-as we did before- put on the graves of the dead of this enormous struggle a wreath inscribed with the words: ""AND YET YOU WERE VICTORIOUS."" I expect every German to do his duty to the last and that he be willing to take upon himself every sacrifice he will be asked to make; I expect of every healthy man that he risk life and limb in this battle. I expect the sick and the weak or those otherwise unavailable for military duty to work with their last strength; I expect city dwellers to forge the weapons for this struggle and I expect the farmer to supply the bread for the soldiers and workers of this struggle by imposing restrictions upon himself; I expect all women and girls to continue supporting this struggle with utmost fanaticism.In this appeal I particularly address myself to the German youth. By forming such a committed community, we have the right to step before the almighty and ask Him for His mercy and blessings. No people can do more than that everybody who can fight, fights, and that everybody who can work, works, and that they all sacrifice in common, filled with but one thought: to secure freedom, national honor and thus the future of life.No matter how grave the crisis may be at this moment, we will overcome it in the end, in spite of everything, thanks to our unchangeable will, our readiness to sacrifice, and our abilities.

 The 1st thing you said is an argument that I already talked about and contradicted the notion of don't be stupid you stupid person.
 
  This kind of disproves your inability to comprehend simple statements already explained why it's not a nazi conspiracy.
 
  Also you didnt address any argument I stated so why are you responding why are you here.
 
 &gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/enoughpetersonspam/comments/qh3ypr/comment/hiaaps0/
 Hello u/Araknhak
 
 Unfortunatly i can not reply to you in r/JordanPeterson because i am banned from this forum, so i reply to you here.
 
 You wrote in [https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/qg8f11/my\_gfs\_father\_called\_jordan\_peterson\_a\_misogynist/](https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/qg8f11/my_gfs_father_called_jordan_peterson_a_misogynist/)
 
 You don't know the following issues with Jordan Peterson?
 
 * women are the chaos dragon
 * oppose contraception
 * can't discuss with a woman
 * make-up at work
 * ¬´ enforced monogamy ¬ª
 * rape is a left-wing taboo
 
  The chaos dragon only represents the architecturally chaotic which is typically embodied by the feminine
 
  It doesnt means women are evil don't be stupid.
 
  What the fuck do you mean Jordan Peterson opposes contrareception the fuck.
 
  I don't know what this 3rd one is supposed to be I mean he had a good conversation with the femsplaners as well Theryn Meyer.who the fuck could he have a wife if you couldn't discuss things with her.
 
  Peterson didn't oppose makeup at work he simply stated that makeup is a sexual signal and feminist who oppose all sexual signals at work are contradictory.
 
  Not necessarily the biggest fan of enforcement argument but Jordan Peterson didn't mean forced an agony in the sense that the state ban's polyam rest relationships enforced monogamy Is a technical concept in which it is enforced culturally.
 
  This last thing is extremely vague I don't know what you're talking about here about here but I mean yeah lefty's typically have a higher affinity to point other people out who are rapist that was Me Too. If that's what you're talking about that's like objectively true.

  Pretty explained why cultural marxism isn't a far right thing at all I'm just gonna recite my sources.
 
 
 Theses on Cultural Marxism
 John Brenkman
 is about Social Text covers a broad spectrum of social and cultural phenomena, applying the latest interpretive methods to the world at large. A daring and controversial leader in the field of cultural studies, the journal consistently focuses attention on questions of gender, sexuality, race, and the environment, publishing key works by the most influential social and cultural theorists. Each issue breaks new ground in the debates about postcolonialism, postmodernism, and popular culture.

  It's also another paper on the name of
  Cultural marxism and political sociology
 
 By Richard R Weiner
 
 
  Is you sighting a whole bunch of news articles and The fucking guardian is not an academic source.
 
 
 Also altrighters don't like him he's too much of an individualist to support a white ethnostate and to separate people on the basis of group identity.
 
  The alt right is actively hates him

 Wondering the actual extent of Peterson‚Äôs support at the Daily Stormer, I looked up the ‚ÄúSavior‚Äù reference and discovered it‚Äôs in a vague three-sentence blog post written by a guy calling himself Joe Jones. It turns out he was likely being ironic about praising Peterson as the messiah. Because, just a month before his ambiguous ‚ÄúSavior‚Äù comment, he wrote: ‚ÄúJordan Peterson is a f*ggot and his fans are also f*ggots.‚Äù One of his other posts is titled: ‚ÄúJordan Peterson‚Äôs Fans are Massive F*ggots with Daddy Issues.‚Äù
 
 Here are the articles in question

  Peterson did not get famous for saying he wouldn't use a transperson's pronouns he got famous for saying that it should not be legal action taken for a person who doesn't want to use trans pronouns He uses Theryn Meyer pronouns.
 
  It was also most certainly regulating peoples speech
 
  Bill C-16 is an Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the department of Justice said that the bill would be interpreted by the Ontario human Rights commission and the precedence and guidelines already established by the Ontario human Rights commission
 
 ""Definitions of the terms ‚Äúgender identity‚Äù and ‚Äúgender expression‚Äù have already been given by the Ontario Human Rights Commission, for example. The Commission has provided helpful discussion and examples that can offer good practical guidance. The Canadian Human Rights Commission will provide similar guidance on the meaning of these terms in the Canadian Human Rights Act.,""
 
 https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/pl/identity-identite/faq.html
 
 The Ontario human right commission's website said that not referring to people by their preferred pronoun will qualify harassment under the law which is being punished with fines.
 
  Also there were trials due to bill C16 regarding pronoun usage

You see it all the time on this website. ‚ÄúWhat do we do?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow do we fight back?‚Äù They have to understand the ideology and then it becomes very clear.This is how the left operates.

Unquote. Quote The Christmas Truce of 1914 ‚Äì Why There Is Still No Peace On Earth By David Stockman David Stockman's Contra Corner December 27, 2021 After the Berlin Wall fell in November 1989 and the death of the Soviet Union was confirmed two years later when Boris Yeltsin courageously stood down the Red Army tanks in front of Moscow‚Äôs White House, a dark era in human history came to an end. The world had descended into a 77-Year War, incepting with the mobilization of the armies of old Europe in August 1914. If you want to count bodies, 150 million were killed by all the depredations that germinated in the Great War, its foolish aftermath at Versailles, and the march of history into World War II and the Cold War that followed inexorably thereupon. Upwards of 8% of the human race was wiped out during that span. The toll encompassed the madness of trench warfare during 1914-1918; the murderous regimes of Soviet and Nazi totalitarianism that rose from the ashes of the Great War and the follies of Versailles; and then the carnage of WWII and all the lesser (unnecessary) wars and invasions of the Cold War including Korea and Vietnam. At the end of the Cold War, therefore, the last embers of the fiery madness that had incepted with the guns of August 1914 had finally burned out. Peace was at hand. Yet 30 years later there is still no peace because Imperial Washington confounds it. In fact, the War Party entrenched in the nation‚Äôs capital is dedicated to economic interests and ideological perversions that guarantee perpetual war. These forces ensure endless waste on armaments; they cause the inestimable death and human suffering that stems from 21st-century high-tech warfare; and they inherently generate terrorist blowback from those upon whom the War Party inflicts its violent hegemony. Worse still, Washington‚Äôs great war machine and teeming national security industry is its own agent of self-perpetuation. When it is not invading, occupying and regime changing, its vast apparatus of internal policy bureaus and outside contractors, lobbies, think tanks and NGOs is busy generating reasons for new imperial ventures. So there was a virulent threat to peace still lurking on the Potomac after the 77-Year War ended. The great general and President, Dwight Eisenhower, had called it the ‚Äúmilitary-industrial-congressional complex‚Äù in the draft of his farewell address. But that memorable phrase had been abbreviated by his speechwriters, who deleted the word ‚Äúcongressional‚Äù in a gesture of comity to the legislative branch. So restore Ike‚Äôs deleted reference to the pork barrels and Sunday-afternoon warriors of Capitol Hill and toss in the legions of Beltway busybodies who constituted the civilian branches of the Cold War armada (CIA, State, AID, NED and the rest) and the circle would have been complete. It constituted the most awesome machine of warfare and imperial hegemony since the Roman legions bestrode most of the civilized world. In a word, the real threat to peace circa 1991 was that the American Imperium would not go away quietly into the good night. In fact, during the past 30 years Imperial Washington has lost all memory that peace was ever possible at the end of the Cold War. Today it is as feckless, misguided and bloodthirsty as were Berlin, Paris, St. Petersburg, Vienna and London in August 1914. A few months after that horrendous slaughter had been unleashed 107 years ago, however, soldiers along the western front broke into spontaneous truces of Christmas celebration, song and even exchange of gifts. For a brief moment they wondered why they were juxtaposed in lethal combat along the jaws of hell. As Will Grigg once described it, A sudden cold snap had left the battlefield frozen, which was actually a relief for troops wallowing in sodden mire. Along the Front, troops extracted themselves from their trenches and dugouts, approaching each other warily, and then eagerly, across No Man‚Äôs Land. Greetings and handshakes were exchanged, as were gifts scavenged from care packages sent from home. German souvenirs that ordinarily would have been obtained only through bloodshed ‚Äì such as spiked pickelhaube helmets, or Gott mit uns belt buckles ‚Äì were bartered for similar British trinkets. Carols were sung in German, English, and French. A few photographs were taken of British and German officers standing alongside each other, unarmed, in No Man‚Äôs Land. Near the Ypres salient, Germans and Scotsmen chased after wild hares that, once caught, served as an unexpected Christmas feast. Perhaps the sudden exertion of chasing wild hares prompted some of the soldiers to think of having a football match. Then again, little prompting would have been necessary to inspire young, competitive men ‚Äì many of whom were English youth recruited off soccer fields ‚Äì to stage a match. In any case, numerous accounts in letters and journals attest to the fact that on Christmas 1914, German and English soldiers played soccer on the frozen turf of No Man‚Äôs Land. British Field Artillery Lieutenant John Wedderburn-Maxwell described the event as ‚Äúprobably the most extraordinary event of the whole war ‚Äì a soldier‚Äôs truce without any higher sanction by officers and generals‚Ä¶.‚Äù The truth is, there was no good reason for the Great War. The world had stumbled into war based on false narratives and the institutional imperatives of military mobilization plans, alliances and treaties arrayed into a doomsday machine and petty short-term diplomatic maneuvers and political calculus. Yet it took more than three-quarters of a century for all the consequential impacts and evils to be purged from the life of the planet. The peace that was lost last time has not been regained this time, however, and for the same reasons. Historians can readily name the culprits from 107 years ago. These include the German general staff‚Äôs plan for a lightning mobilization and strike on the western front called the Schlieffen Plan; the incompetence and intrigue in the court at St. Petersburg; French President Poincare‚Äôs anti-German irredentism owing to the 1871 loss of his home province, Alsace-Lorraine; and the bloodthirsty cabal around Winston Churchill who forced England into an unnecessary war, among countless others. Since these casus belli of 1914 were criminally trivial in light of all that metastasized thereafter, it might do well to name the institutions and false narratives that block the return of peace today. The fact is, these impediments are even more contemptible than the forces that crushed the Christmas truces one century ago. IMPERIAL WASHINGTON ‚Äì THE NEW GLOBAL MENACE There is no peace on earth today for reasons mainly rooted in Imperial Washington ‚Äì not Moscow, Beijing, Tehran, Damascus, Mosul or the rubble of what remains of Raqqa. Imperial Washington has become a global menace owing to what didn‚Äôt happen in 1991. At that crucial inflection point, Bush the Elder should have declared ‚Äúmission accomplished‚Äù and parachuted into the great Ramstein air base in Germany to begin the demobilization of the America‚Äôs war machine. So doing, he could have slashed the Pentagon budget from $600 billion to $250 billion (2015 $); demobilized the military-industrial complex by putting a moratorium on all new weapons development, procurement and export sales; dissolved NATO and dismantled the far-flung network of U.S. military bases; reduced the United States‚Äô standing armed forces from 1.5 million to a few hundred thousand; and organized and led a world-disarmament and peace campaign, as did his Republican predecessors during the 1920s. Unfortunately, George H. W. Bush was not a man of peace, vision or even middling intelligence. He was the malleable tool of the War Party, and it was he who single-handedly blew the peace when, in the very year the 77-Year War ended with the demise of the Soviet Union, he plunged America into a petty argument between the impetuous dictator of Iraq and the gluttonous emir of Kuwait. But that argument was none of George Bush‚Äôs or America‚Äôs business. By contrast, even though liberal historians have reviled Warren G. Harding as some kind of dummkopf politician, he well understood that the Great War had been for naught, and that to ensure it never happened again the nations of the world needed to rid themselves of their huge navies and standing armies. To that end, he achieved the largest global-disarmament agreement ever during the Washington Naval Conference of 1921, which halted the construction of new battleships for more than a decade. And even then, the moratorium ended only because the vengeful victors at Versailles never ceased exacting their revenge on Germany. And while he was at it, President Harding also pardoned Eugene Debs. In so doing, he gave witness to the truth that the intrepid socialist candidate for president and vehement antiwar protester, who Woodrow Wilson had thrown in prison for exercising his First Amendment right to speak against US entry into a pointless European war, had been right all along. In short, Warren G. Harding knew the war was over and the folly of Wilson‚Äôs 1917 plunge into Europe‚Äôs bloodbath should not be repeated, at all hazards. But not George H. W. Bush. The man should never be forgiven for enabling the likes of Dick Cheney, Paul Wolfowitz, Robert Gates and their neocon pack of jackals to come to power ‚Äì even if he eventually denounced them in his doddering old age. Alas, upon his death, Bush the Elder was deified, not vilified, by the mainstream press and the bipartisan duopoly. And that tells you all you need to know about why Washington is ensnared in its Forever Wars and is the very reason why there is still no peace on earth. Even more to the point, by opting not for peace but for war and oil in the Persian Gulf in 1991 Washington opened the gates to an unnecessary confrontation with Islam and nurtured the rise of jihadist terrorism that would not haunt the world today save for forces unleashed by George H. W. Bush‚Äôs petulant quarrel with Saddam Hussein. We will momentarily get to the 47-year-old error that holds the Persian Gulf is an American lake and that the answer to high oil prices and energy security is the Fifth Fleet. Suffice it to say here that the answer to high oil prices everywhere and always is high oil prices ‚Äì a truth driven home in spades by the oil busts of 2009, 2015 and 2020, and the fact the real price of oil today (2019 $) is lower than it was on the eve of the great oil embargo of 1973. But first it is well to remember that in 1991 there was no plausible threat anywhere on the planet to the safety and security of the citizens of Springfield, MA, Lincoln, NE or Spokane, WA when the Cold War ended. The Warsaw Pact had dissolved into more than a dozen woebegone sovereign statelets; the Soviet Union was now unscrambled into 15 independent and far-flung republics from Belarus to Tajikistan; and the Russian motherland would soon plunge into an economic depression that would leave it with a GDP about the size of the Philadelphia SMSA. Likewise, China‚Äôs GDP was even smaller and more primitive than Russia‚Äôs. Even as Mr. Deng was discovering the People‚Äôs Bank of China‚Äôs printing press, which would enable it to become a great mercantilist exporter, an incipient Chinese threat to national security was never in the cards. After all, it was the 4,000 Walmarts in America upon which the prosperity of the new Red Capitalism inextricably depended and upon which the rule of the Communist oligarchs in Beijing was ultimately anchored. Even the hardliners among them could see that in swapping militarism for mercantilism and after invading America with tennis shoes, neckties, home textiles and electronics ‚Äì that the door had been closed to any other kind of invasion thereafter. NO ISLAMIC TERRORISTS OR JIHADI THREAT CIRCA 1991 Likewise, in 1991 there was no global Islamic threat or jihadi terrorist menace at all. What existed under those headings were sundry fragments and deposits of Middle Eastern religious, ethnic and tribal histories that were of moment in their immediate region, but no threat to America‚Äôs homeland security whatsoever. The Shiite/Sunni divide had coexisted since A.D. 671, but its episodic eruptions into battles and wars over the centuries had rarely extended beyond the region, and certainly had no reason to fester into open conflict in 1991. Inside the artificial state of Iraq, which had been drawn on a map by historically ignorant European diplomats in 1916, for instance, the Shiite and Sunni got along tolerably. That‚Äôs because the nation was ruled by Saddam Hussein‚Äôs Baathist brand of secular Arab nationalism, flavored by a muscular propensity for violent repression of internal dissent. Hussein championed law and order, state-driven economic development and politically apportioned distributions from the spoils of the extensive government-controlled oil sector. To be sure, Baathist socialism didn‚Äôt bring much prosperity to the well-endowed lands of Mesopotamia, but Hussein did have a Christian foreign minister and no sympathy for religious extremism or violent pursuit of sectarian causes. As it happened, the bloody Shiite/Sunni strife that plagues Iraq, Syria and the greater middle east today and which functioned as a hatchery for angry young jihadi terrorists in their thousands was initially unleashed only after Hussein had been driven from Kuwait in 1991 and the CIA had instigated an armed uprising in the Shiite heartland around Basra.. That revolt was brutally suppressed by Hussein‚Äôs republican guards, but it left an undertow of resentment and revenge boiling below the surface. That was one of many of George H. W. Bush‚Äôs fetid legacies in the region. Needless to say, when it came their turn, Bush the Younger and his cabal of neocon warmongers could not leave well enough alone. When they foolishly destroyed Saddam Hussein and his entire regime in the pursuit of nonexistent WMDs and alleged ties with al-Qaeda, they literally opened the gates of hell, leaving Iraq as a lawless failed state where both recent and ancient religious and tribal animosities were given unlimited violent vent. WHY THE WAR PARTY NEEDED TO DEMONIZE IRAN Also circa 1990, the Shiite theocracy ensconced in Tehran was no threat to America‚Äôs safety and security ‚Äì even if it was an unfortunate albatross on the Persian people. The very idea that Tehran is an expansionist power bent on exporting terrorism to the rest of the world is a giant fiction and tissue of lies invented by the Washington War Party and its Bibi Netanyahu branch in order to win political support for their confrontationist policies. Indeed, the three-decade-long demonization of Iran has served one overarching purpose. Namely, it has enabled both branches of the War Party to conjure up a fearsome enemy, thereby justifying aggressive policies that call for a constant state of war and military mobilization. Indeed, Iran has not been demonized by happenstance. When the Cold War officially ended in 1991, the Cheney/neocon cabal deeply feared the kind of drastic demobilization of the US military-industrial complex that was warranted by the suddenly more pacific strategic environment. In response, they developed an anti-Iranian doctrine that was explicitly described as a way of keeping defense spending at high Cold War levels. If the fearsome Soviet Union was gone, a vastly inflated threat emanating from Iran‚Äôs minuscule GDP of $450 billion and tiny defense budget of $17 billion would needs be invented and hyperbolized. And the narrative they developed to this end is one of the more egregious Big Lies ever to come out of the Beltway. It puts you in mind of the young boy who killed his parents, and then threw himself on the mercy of the courts on the grounds that he was an orphan! To wit, during the 1980s the neocons in the Reagan Administration issued their own fatwa against the Islamic Republic of Iran based on its rhetorical hostility to America. Yet that enmity was grounded in Washington‚Äôs 25-year support for the tyrannical and illegitimate regime of the Shah, and constituted a founding narrative of the Islamic Republic that was not much different than America‚Äôs revolutionary castigation of King George. That the Iranians had a case is beyond doubt. The open US archives now prove that the CIA overthrew Iran‚Äôs democratically elected government in 1953 and put the utterly unsuited and megalomaniacal Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi on the Peacock Throne to rule as a puppet on behalf of US security and oil interests. During the subsequent decades the Shah not only massively and baldly plundered the wealth of the Persian nation; with the help of the CIA and US military, he also created a brutal secret police force known as SAVAK. The latter made the East German Stasi look civilized by comparison. All elements of Iranian society including universities, labor unions, businesses, civic organizations, peasant farmers and many more were subjected to intense surveillance by the SAVAK agents and paid informants. As one critic described it: Over the years, Savak became a law unto itself, having legal authority to arrest, detain, brutally interrogate and torture suspected people indefinitely. Savak operated its own prisons in Tehran, such as Qezel-Qalaeh and Evin facilities and many suspected places throughout the country as well. Many of those activities were carried out without any institutional checks. Ironically, among his many grandiose follies, the Shah had embarked on a massive civilian nuclear-power campaign in the 1970s, which envisioned literally paving the Iranian landscape with dozens of nuclear power plants. He would use Iran‚Äôs surging oil revenues after 1973 to buy all the equipment required from Western companies ‚Äì and also fuel-cycle support services such as uranium enrichment ‚Äì in order to provide his kingdom with cheap power for centuries. At the time of the revolution, the first of these plants at Bushehr was nearly complete, but the whole grandiose project was put on hold amidst the turmoil of the new regime and the onset of Saddam Hussein‚Äôs war against Iran in September 1980. As a consequence, a $2 billion deposit languished at the French nuclear agency that had originally obtained it from the Shah to fund a ramp-up of its enrichment capacity to supply his planned battery of reactors. Indeed, in this very context the new Iranian regime proved quite dramatically that it was not hell-bent on obtaining nuclear bombs or any other weapons of mass destruction. In the midst of Iraq‚Äôs unprovoked invasion of Iran in the early 1980s, Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa against biological and chemical weapons. Yet at that very time, Saddam was dropping these horrific weapons on Iranian battle forces ‚Äì some of them barely armed teenage boys ‚Äì with the spotting help of CIA tracking satellites and the concurrence of Washington. So from the very beginning, the Iranian posture was wholly contrary to the War Party‚Äôs endless blizzard of false charges about its quest for nukes. However benighted and medieval its religious views, the theocracy that ruled Iran did not consist of demented warmongers. In the heat of battle they were willing to sacrifice their own forces rather than violate their religious scruples to counter Saddam‚Äôs WMDs. HOW WASHINGTON INSPIRED THE MYTH OF IRAN‚ÄôS SECRET NUCLEAR-WEAPONS PROGRAM Then in 1983 the new Iranian regime decided to complete the Bushehr power plant and some additional elements of the Shah‚Äôs grand plan. But when they attempted to reactivate the French enrichment-services contract and buy necessary power plant equipment from the original German suppliers they were stopped cold by Washington. And when they tried to get their $2 billion deposit back, they were curtly denied that, too. To make a long story short, the entire subsequent history of off-again, on-again efforts by the Iranians to purchase dual-use equipment and components on the international market, often from black market sources like Pakistan, was in response to Washington‚Äôs relentless efforts to block its legitimate rights as a signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to complete some parts of the Shah‚Äôs civilian nuclear project. Needless to say, it did not take much effort by the neocon ‚Äúregime change‚Äù fanatics that inhabited Washington‚Äôs national-security machinery, especially after the 2000 election, to spin every attempt by Iran to purchase even a lowly pump or pipe fitting as evidence of a secret campaign to get ‚Äúthe bomb‚Äù. The exaggerations, lies, distortions and fear mongering that came out of this neocon campaign are truly deplorable. Yet they incepted way back in the early 1990s when George H. W. Bush actually did reach out to the newly elected government of Hashemi Rafsanjani to bury the hatchet after it had cooperated in obtaining the release of American prisoners being held in Lebanon in 1989. Rafsanjani was self-evidently a pragmatist who did not want conflict with the United States and the West; and after the devastation of the eight-year war with Iraq, he was wholly focused on economic reconstruction and even free market reforms of Iran‚Äôs faltering economy. It is one of the great tragedies of history that the neocons managed to squelch even Bush the Elder‚Äôs better instincts with respect to rapprochement with Tehran. So the prisoner-release opening was short-lived ‚Äì especially after the top post at the CIA was assumed in 1991 by the despicable Robert Gates. He was one of the very worst of the unreconstructed Cold War apparatchiks who looked peace in the eye, and elected, instead, to pervert John Quincy Adams‚Äô wise maxim. That is, Gates spent the rest of his career searching the globe for monsters to fabricate. In this case the motivation was especially loathsome. Gates had been Bill Casey‚Äôs right-hand man during the latter‚Äôs rogue tenure at the CIA in the Reagan Administration. Among the many untoward projects that Gates shepherded was the Iran-Contra affair that nearly destroyed his career when it blew up, and for which he blamed the Iranians for its public disclosure. From his post as deputy national-security director in 1989 (and then as CIA head shortly thereafter), Gates pulled out all the stops to get even. Almost single-handedly he killed off the White House goodwill from the prisoner release, and launched the blatant myth that Iran was both sponsoring terrorism and seeking to obtain nuclear weapons. Indeed, it was Gates who was the architect of the demonization of Iran that became a staple of War Party propaganda after 1991. In time that morphed into the utterly false claim that Iran is an aggressive would-be hegemon and a fount of terrorism dedicated to the destruction of the state of Israel, among other treacherous purposes. The latter giant lie was almost single-handedly fashioned by the neocons and Bibi Netanyahu‚Äôs coterie of power-hungry henchman after the mid-1990s. Indeed, the false claim that Iran posed an ‚Äúexistential threat‚Äù to Israel is a product of the pure red meat domestic Israeli politics that kept Bibi in power for much of the last two decades ‚Äì a plague on mankind that has hopefully finally ended. But the truth is Iran has only a tiny fraction of Israel‚Äôs conventional military capability. And compared to the latter‚Äôs 100-odd nukes, Iran never even had a nuclear weaponization program after a small-scale research program was abandoned in 2003. And that is not our opinion. It was the sober assessment of the nation‚Äôs top 17 intelligence agencies in the official National Intelligence Estimates (NIEs) for 2007, and has been confirmed ever since. It‚Äôs the reason that the neocon plan to bomb Iran at the end of George W. Bush‚Äôs term didn‚Äôt happen. As Dubya confessed in his autobiography, even he couldn‚Äôt figure out how he could explain to the American public why he was bombing facilities that all his intelligence agencies had said did not exist. That is, he would have been impaled on WMD 2.0 on his way out of the White House. Moreover, now via a further study arising from the 2015 international nuclear accord ‚Äì which would have straitjacketed even Iran‚Äôs civilian program and eliminated most of its enriched-uranium stockpiles and spinning capacity had not the Donald foolishly ash-canned it ‚Äì the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has also confirmed that Iran had no secret nuclear-weapons program after 2003. The whole scary bedtime story was false War Party propaganda manufactured from whole cloth. MORE WAR PARTY LIES ‚Äì DEMONIZATION OF THE SHIITE CRESCENT In this context, the War Party‚Äôs bloviating about Iran‚Äôs leadership of the so-called Shiite Crescent is another component of Imperial Washington‚Äôs 30-year-long roadblock to peace. Iran wasn‚Äôt a threat to American security in 1991, and since then it has never organized a hostile coalition of terrorists that requires Washington‚Äôs intervention. Start with Iran‚Äôs long-standing support of Bashir Assad‚Äôs government in Syria. That alliance goes back to his father‚Äôs era and is rooted in the historic confessional politics of the Islamic world. The Assad regime is Alawite, a branch of the Shiites, and despite the regime‚Äôs brutality, it has been a bulwark of protection for all of Syria‚Äôs minority sects, including Christians, against a majority-Sunni ethnic cleansing. The latter would surely occur if US and Saudi-supported rebels, led by the Nusra Front and ISIS, had been permitted to take full power. Likewise, the fact that the Baghdad government of the broken state of Iraq ‚Äì that is, the artificial 1916 concoction of two striped-pants European diplomats (Messrs. Sykes and Picot of the British and French foreign offices, respectively) ‚Äì is now aligned with Iran is also a result of confessional politics and geo-economic propinquity. For all practical purposes, Iraq has been partitioned. The Kurds of the northeast have declared their independence and have been collecting their own oil revenue for the past few years and operating their own security forces. And the western Sunni lands of the upper Euphrates, of course, were first conquered by ISIS with American weapons dropped in place by the hapless $25 billion Iraqi army minted by Washington‚Äôs departing proconsuls; and then obliterated during Obama‚Äôs (and the Trump‚Äôs) vicious bombing and droning campaign designed to uproot the terrorist evil that Washington itself had spawned. Accordingly, what is left of the rump state of Iraq is a population that is overwhelmingly Shiite and nurses bitter resentments after two decades of violent conflict with the Sunni forces. Why in the world, therefore, wouldn‚Äôt they ally with their Shiite neighbor? Likewise, the claim that Iran is now trying to annex Yemen, thereby justifying the mayhem wreaked upon it by the Saudi air war, is pure claptrap. The ancient territory of Yemen had been racked by civil war off and on since the early 1970s. And a major driving force of that conflict has been confessional differences between the Sunni South and the Shiite North. In more recent times, Washington‚Äôs blatant drone war inside Yemen against alleged terrorists and its domination and financing of Yemen‚Äôs government eventually produced the same old outcome ‚Äì that is, another failed state and an illegitimate government that fled at the 11th hour, leaving another vast cache of American arms and equipment behind. Accordingly, the Houthis forces now in control of substantial parts of the country are not some kind of advanced guard sent in by Tehran. They are indigenous partisans who share a confessional tie with Iran, but who have actually been armed, if inadvertently, by Washington. Finally, there is the fourth element of the purported Iranian axis ‚Äì the Hezbollah-controlled Shiite communities of southern Lebanon and the Beqaa Valley in the northeast. Like everything else in the Middle East, Hezbollah is a product of historical European imperialism, Islamic confessional politics and the frequently misguided and counterproductive security policies of Israel. In the first place, Lebanon was not any more a real country than Iraq was when Sykes and Picot laid their straight-edged rulers on a map. The result was a stew of religious and ethnic divisions ‚Äì Maronite Catholics, Greek Orthodox, Copts, Druse, Sunnis, Shiites, Alawites, Kurds, Armenians, Jews and countless more ‚Äì that made the fashioning of a viable state virtually impossible. At length, an alliance of Christians and Sunnis gained control of the country, leaving the 40% Shiite population disenfranchised and economically disadvantaged, as well. But it was the inflow of Palestinian refugees in the 1960s and 1970s that eventually upset the balance of sectarian forces and triggered a civil war that essentially lasted from 1975 until the turn of the century. It also triggered a catastrophically wrong-headed Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon in 1982, and a subsequent repressive occupation of mostly Shiite territories for the next 18 years. The alleged purpose of this invasion was to chase the PLO and Yasser Arafat out of the enclave in southern Lebanon that they had established after being driven out of Jordan in 1970. Eventually Israel succeeded in sending Arafat packing to North Africa, but in the process created a militant, Shiite-based resistance movement that did not even exist in 1982 and that in due course became the strongest single force in Lebanon‚Äôs fractured domestic political arrangements. After Israel withdrew in 2000, the then-Christian president of the country made abundantly clear that Hezbollah had become a legitimate and respected force within the Lebanese polity, not merely some subversive agent of Tehran: ‚ÄúFor us Lebanese, and I can tell you the majority of Lebanese, Hezbollah is a national resistance movement. If it wasn‚Äôt for them, we couldn‚Äôt have liberated our land. And because of that, we have big esteem for the Hezbollah movement.‚Äù So, yes, Hezbollah is an integral component of the so-called Shiite Crescent, and its confessional and political alignment with Tehran is entirely plausible. But that arrangement ‚Äì however uncomfortable for Israel ‚Äì does not represent unprovoked Iranian aggression on Israel‚Äôs northern border. Instead, it‚Äôs actually the blowback from the stubborn refusal of Israeli governments ‚Äì especially the right-wing Likud governments of modern times ‚Äì to deal constructively with the Palestinian question. In lieu of a two-state solution in the territory of Palestine, therefore, Israeli policy has produced a chronic state of confrontation and war with the huge share of the Lebanese population represented by Hezbollah. The latter is surely no agency of peaceful governance and has committed its share of atrocities. But the point at hand is that given the last 35 years of history and Israeli policy, Hezbollah would exist as a menacing force on its northern border even if the Iranian theocracy didn‚Äôt exist and the shah or his heir was still on the Peacock Throne. In short, there is no alliance of terrorism in the Shiite Crescent that threatens American security. That proposition is simply one of the big lies that was promulgated by the War Party after 1991 and that has been happily embraced by Imperial Washington since then in order to keep the military-industrial-security complex alive, and justify its self-appointed role as policeman of the world. WASHINGTON‚ÄôS ERRONEOUS VIEW THAT THE PERSIAN GULF IS AN AMERICAN LAKE ‚Äì THE ROOT OF SUNNI JIHADISM The actual terrorist threat has arisen from the Sunni, not the Shiite, side of the Islamic divide. But that, in turn, is largely of Washington‚Äôs own making; and it is being nurtured by endless US meddling in the region‚Äôs politics and by the bombing and droning campaigns against Washington‚Äôs self-created enemies. At the root of Sunni-based terrorism is the long-standing Was",httpswwwtrumanlibrarygovlibraryoralhistorieswright read link historical looted position tyranny rubber hose media warred us full since

The ""moral subversion of the West"" is not the product of the KGB, but of the CIA which went so far as to finance ""modern"" art throughout the West because it considered Soviet realist art a propagandist danger. The KGB subversion was about funding and infiltrating parties and syndicates to instigate strikes and revolutions, as well as funding armed guerrillas. The CIA subversion countered this by seeking to turn revolutionaries into ""hippies"".On the right wing, the CIA created a false opposition to communism using a bionic patriotism infused by pop culture that attracted conservatives, always praising the free market and big American capital so that it would remain untouchable. The purpose was only one: to make conservatives oppose communism without opposing communism's initial financiers. Then the lie was told that the New-Left was a thing of the USSR so that unwary conservatives thought that fighting Progressism was fighting communism, without realizing that such shit came from big capital, untouchable and ideologically defended by conservatives. Today, however, everything is more explicit and only those who were victims of propaganda believe in the myth of Soviet moral subversion. Many of these adhered to the culture war discourse without ever going further to attack the root of the problem: multinationals, banks, media, liberal democracy, freedom of association for the conspirators - all of this is treated as a ""defense of Western civilization"", which is another Cold War propaganda speech.",cultural marxism never existed cultural liberalism within critical theory frankfurt school created west sought make epistemological review classical marxist theory also opposition ussr moral subversion west product kgb cia went far finance modern art throughout west considered soviet realist art propagandist danger kgb subversion funding infiltrating parties syndicates instigate strikes revolutions well funding armed guerrillas cia subversion countered seeking turn revolutionaries hippieson right wing cia created false opposition communism using bionic patriotism infused pop culture attracted conservatives always praising free market big american capital would remain untouchable purpose one make conservatives oppose communism without opposing communisms initial financiers lie told newleft thing ussr unwary conservatives thought fighting progressism fighting communism without realizing shit came big capital untouchable ideologically defended conservatives today however everything explicit victims propaganda believe myth soviet moral subversion many adhered culture war discourse without ever going attack root problem multinationals banks media liberal democracy freedom association conspirators treated defense western civilization another cold war propaganda speech,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0

It was a bad time and place to be a Jewish Marxist, as most of the school‚Äôs faculty was. So, the school moved to New York City, the bastion of Western culture at the time.Max Horkheimer¬†was a dedicated Marxist who helped to create what is known as Critical Theory through radical Marxism. In 1930 he joined with a Marxist study group, started by Felix Weil, which evolved into the Institute for Social Research and is now known as the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory. Critical Theory maintains that ideology (Christianity) is the principal ‚Äúobstacle‚Äù to human liberation‚Ä¶In 1934, the Frankfurt School was reborn at¬†Columbia University. Its members began to exert their ideas on American culture. It was at Columbia University that the school honed the tool it would use to destroy Western culture: the printed word.The school published a lot of popular material. The first of these was¬†Critical Theory.Marcuse would be the one to answer Horkheimer‚Äôs question from the 1930s: Who would replace the working class as the new vanguards of the Marxist revolution? Marcuse believed that it would be a victim coalition of minorities‚Äîblacks, women, and homosexuals.The social movements of the 1960s‚Äîblack power, feminism, gay rights, sexual liberation‚Äîgave Marcuse a unique vehicle to release cultural Marxist ideas into the mainstream.

Cultural Marxism,2022-11-28,9:08:12,>CodezVII<,Telegram,https://t.me/CodezVII/3845,"> THE TRUE ORIGINS OF CULTURAL MARXISM"" > Kabbalists believe that God was shattered by the act of Creation, and that His attributes lay as ""holy sparks"" imbedded in Creation which must be picked up in order for Him to be restored to oneness (known as the act of tikkun). The kabbalist therefore believes that the Jewsish Messiah will never arrive and thus Mankind will never be liberated until God is restored to oneness. The way to do this, according to the kabbalists, is to engage in acts of holiness and meditation in order to retrieve the sparks of God. In the year 1666, a kabbalist and occultist named Sabbatai Zevi declared himself the Jewish Messiah. Upon his messiahship, he turned the Torah around by declaring that all sins were now considered ""holy"" and that the only way to ""repair"" God was to engage in acts of depravity. He lost several followers after the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire forced him to convert to Islam, however, several Jews still followed him. 100 years later, Jacob Frank declared himself to be the reincarnation of Sabbatai Zevi and took those ideas to an even more extreme level. In order for God to be fully repaired and for the Messianic Era to arrive, mankind must destroy all of its traditional moral values and go beyond good and evil. The Frankists, as they were called, engaged in every horrible thing you could imagine: black magic, wife-swapping, sex orgies, homosexuality, incest, pedophilia, and promoted a form of proto-feminism and proto-communism. Every one of these disgusting acts was considered to be a ""holy tikkun"" (restoration) of God if done with holy intent. They were entirely apocalyptic who despised the world of creation, seeking to bring about its early end and to bring forth a Messianic utopia. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Subscribe: https://t.me/CodezVII >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>",true origins cultural marxism kabbalists believe god shattered act creation attributes lay holy sparks imbedded creation must picked order restored oneness known act tikkun kabbalist therefore believes jewsish messiah never arrive thus mankind never liberated god restored oneness way according kabbalists engage acts holiness meditation order retrieve sparks god year kabbalist occultist named sabbatai zevi declared jewish messiah upon messiahship turned torah around declaring sins considered holy way repair god engage acts depravity lost several followers sultan ottoman empire forced convert islam however several jews still followed years later jacob frank declared reincarnation sabbatai zevi took ideas even extreme level order god fully repaired messianic era arrive mankind must destroy traditional moral values go beyond good evil frankists called engaged every horrible thing could imagine black magic wifeswapping sex orgies homosexuality incest pedophilia promoted form protofeminism protocommunism every one disgusting acts considered holy tikkun restoration god done holy intent entirely apocalyptic despised world creation seeking bring early end bring forth messianic utopia subscribe httpstmecodezvii,6,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0

Is Everyone Really Equal?: An Introduction to Key Concepts in Social Justice Education, first edition. Teacher‚Äôs College Press: New York, 2012, p. 39.To oppress is to hold down‚Äîto press‚Äîand deny a social group full access and potential in a given society. Oppression describes a set of policies, practices, traditions, norms, definitions, and explanations (discourses), which function to systemically exploit one social group to the benefit of another social group. The group that benefits from this exploitation is called the dominant (or agent) group and the group that is exploited is called the minoritized (or target) group.New Discourses CommentaryOppression is one of the central concepts of the Critical Social Justice mentality. It is, alongside marginalization and other forms of social injustice, the chief concern of Social Justice, and the exposure and subsequent disruption and dismantling of any system of power that produces it (or these) is its primary agenda. This would, perhaps, be useful and poignant if the term were treated in a reasonable sense, speaking primarily about genuine oppression‚Äîparticularly but not exclusively when institutional‚Äîrather than the far vaguer systemic oppressions that Theory is dedicated to exploring, which are often highly interpretive and, well, theoretical in nature.According to Theory, oppression affects all minoritized groups, this including racial minorities, women, gender and sexual minorities, the disabled, the overweight, those from countries or cultures outside of ‚Äúthe West,‚Äù and indigenous people (see also, racism, cultural racism, institutional racism, anti-blackness, sexism, colonialism, imperialism, Eurocentrism, Western-centrism, ableism, fatphobia, homophobia, transphobia, misogyny, transmisogyny, subaltern, and settler, and also, critical race Theory, queer Theory, postcolonial Theory, gender studies, women‚Äôs studies; feminism, black feminism, ethnic studies; disability studies, fat studies, cultural studies, masculinities studies, whiteness studies, decoloniality, orientalism, critical theory, and critical pedagogy). Oppression is the diametric opposite of (systemic) dominance (see also, patriarchy, white supremacy, whiteness, disableism, thinnormativity, heterosexism, heteronormativity, and compulsory heterosexuality). Dominance, in Theory, results from and is the result of the privilege of groups that have greater access to systemic and institutional power (see epistemic injustice, epistemic oppression, epistemic violence, and exclusion).Theory reifies oppression, which is to say that it gives it a status of ‚Äúreal‚Äù within material reality. Specifically, Theory reifies oppression by systemic power, which it understands to operate primarily as a function of identity, having left economic class issues mostly (but not entirely) behind (see also, classism). In the same sense that Cartesian philosophy reifies being with the famous statement cogito, ergo sum‚ÄîI think, therefore I am‚Äîthe Theory of Critical Social Justice reifies oppression based on identity‚ÄîI experience oppression, therefore I am‚Äîthus identity categories that it readily recognizes to be socially constructed (see also, structuralism, poststructrualism, postmodernism, and social constructivism). In that sense, oppression and group identity are the bedrock concepts of Critical Social Justice Theory, and these are specifically set aside as that which must not be deconstructed, even while everything else can and should be.The mission of Theory (thus Social Justice) is to identify oppression (as it sees it) everywhere it occurs, make it more visible, expose the underlying hidden biases and assumptions that create and enable it, and problematize, subvert, disrupt, and dismantle the processes that enable its continuation, rationalization, or legitimation (by the powerful). To do this, it uses critical methods (specifically, critical theories, from which the term ‚ÄúTheory‚Äù is partially derived), which are tasked with these endeavors. To become aware of oppression (and thus privilege and domination) as Theory conceptualizes it is to develop a critical consciousness, which more recently under Social Justice has taken on the more specific meaning of ‚Äúwokeness‚Äù (see also, false consciousness, consciousness raising, and feminist consciousness).Oppression can be so subtle as to be undetectable even by the people who experience it until they develop a critical consciousness (become woke). This often leads people of color, women, and other minoritized groups to go along with the white, patriarchal, heteronormative social order and rationalize it as natural or good on its merits (see also, ideology, liberalism, meritocracy, human nature, and individualism). This leads oppressed people to develop a kind of false consciousness about their oppression‚Äîthis being a concept that derives more or less directly, with modification, from Marx (see also, Marxism, Marxian, Neo-Marxism, Post-Marxism, Cultural Marxism, and Frankfurt School)‚Äîthat requires exposure through adopting critical methods.This problem can manifest in two primary interrelated ways: internalization through socialization (a kind of brainwashing by the overarching culture ‚Äì see also, hegemony) or through cynical self-interest, in which members of minoritized reject solidarity with the critical cause in favor of succeeding in the overarching dominant systems of power (see also, acting white and white adjacent). These can happen in various degrees in tandem.In the first of these mechanisms‚Äîinternalization through socialization‚Äîmembers of minoritized groups are essentially brainwashed (socialized) to accept and embrace the dominant system as natural, good, reasonable, or just the way it is (see also, status quo). In this case, with race, people of color may be socialized into supporting white supremacy (as Theory defines it) via ‚Äúinternalized racism,‚Äù women may support patriarchy via ‚Äúinternalized sexism‚Äù and ‚Äúinternalized misogyny,‚Äù LGBT people may support heteronormativity via ‚Äúinternalized homophobia‚Äù and ‚Äúinternalized heteronormativity‚Äù (see also, straight passing), the disabled may support ableism (thus disableism) via ‚Äúinternalized ableism,‚Äù overweight people might support thinnormativity via ‚Äúinternalized fatphobia,‚Äù and trans people may support cisnormativity through ‚Äúinternalized transphobia‚Äù and ‚Äúinternalized transsexism.‚Äù All of these are understood under a broader rubric of ‚Äúinternalized oppression‚Äù that posits that the social pressures that normalize the systems of dominance and oppression in society are so powerful, pervasive, and influential that they even trick people who are oppressed by them into supporting them. This, obviously, only works in the cases of Stockholm Syndrome or when the ‚Äúoppression‚Äù in question is actually really vague, systemic, and perhaps not very much like oppression at all.In the second‚Äîcynical self-interest‚Äîmembers of minoritized groups may realize, for good reasons or bad, that it is in their better interests to ‚Äúsell out‚Äù and support the dominant paradigm rather than becoming a ‚Äúcritical‚Äù activist against it. This may lead people of color to seek white approval, to act white, or to position themselves as white adjacent. All of these concepts are ways in which minoritized racial groups can support whiteness, thus white supremacy, by actually believing in the things Theorized to be part of these systems or, more cynically, by taking care of their own interests rather than becoming radical activists aiming for a social revolution. (Of note, whiteness and white supremacy have been stated to be perpetuated and forwarded through ideas like punctuality, having a meeting agenda, and mathematics, so what Theory considers the ‚Äúsystem‚Äù of whiteness may contain a lot of ideas that most sensible people‚Äîof color or not‚Äîwould support.) Women may be said to be seeking male approval or patriarchal reward, or when patriarchy is Theorized as intrinsically tied up with capitalism, neoliberal reward. LGBT people will be accused of straight passing and thus not being authentically gay.The flip side of these issues is also deeply Theorized as a way that oppression is maintained by the dominant, who (in keeping consistent with the critical mindset) are not only usually unaware of the oppression they‚Äôre causing but are comfortable as such and don‚Äôt want to (or aren‚Äôt able to) engage that reality without considerable work. This leads to concepts like internalized dominance, where dominant people are socialized to believe that their dominance is natural and earned (see also, human nature and meritocracy). It is also the site of a host of rather abusive concepts that try to explain how this works and, frankly, use it as a cudgel to induce guilt and shame in members of ‚Äúdominant‚Äù groups. These include a dizzying array of largely fictional (perhaps projected) concepts: the racial contract, active ignorance, pernicious ignorance, willful ignorance, white talk, colortalk, white comfort, white equilibrium, complicity and white complicity, white solidarity, aversive racism, white fragility, white woman tears, male tears, racial stress, racial stamina, white innocence, and white ignorance, more or less any of which could be generalized then respecified along other axes of systemic oppression based on identity (see also, intersectionality).Oppression, in Social Justice, can be pretty mild. It might include genuine oppression and discrimination, on the one hand, and it can include having to endure microaggressions, hearing someone disagree with Theory, or meeting the basic expectations of civil society (which, in the West, are deemed to be manifestations of whiteness or patriarchy). For example, the existence of the once-popular 1990s television show Friends is considered highly problematic and thus oppressive to various minoritized groups, including trans people, LGBT, disabled, and fat people (due to some of the jokes used in the show) and people of color (especially black people) because of the show‚Äôs racial demography (and that it in many respects remade an earlier 1990s television show with an almost all-black cast called Living Single). In the Washington state legislature‚Äôs Equity Task Force, making a meeting agenda, showing up on time to the meeting, and getting things done in the agenda are described as ‚Äúwhite supremacy,‚Äù which we can conclude induce oppression, presumably of people of color (it is further suggested in that meeting that these standards wouldn‚Äôt be expected or kept in South Africa, which is held up as a favorable model for the Washington state government). People (especially men) generally preferring it when women look nice is also a form of oppression of women, as is the typical higher cost of women‚Äôs hair styling, despite it usually being a bigger job (that is mostly done by other women who have clearly internalized misogyny along the way). Other examples (or ‚Äúproofs‚Äù) of systemic oppression can be found in disparate outcomes by race and gender on mathematics tests, leading some Theorists (like Tian An and Rochelle Gutierrez) to explain that mathematics is ‚Äúoperating as whiteness.‚ÄùThe way oppression is usually Theorized is under a doctrine of its being immanent, that is, everywhere, always, pervasive, and just beneath the surface, although it‚Äôs rarely explicitly phrased that way. We hear critical race Theorists (e.g., Robin DiAngelo) insist, however, that ‚Äúracism is permanent and ordinary‚Äù and instruct that ‚Äúthe question is not ‚Äòdid racism occur?‚Äô but ‚Äòhow did racism manifest in that situation?‚Äô‚Äù This, of course, assumes the racism was there to begin with, hidden just beneath the surface and needing a critical awareness to find and expose. That is, Theory begins with the assumption that certain demographic groups suffer oppression from vague systemic forces and then goes looking for the evidence to support that assumption. Other groups‚Äîstraight (or, specifically, cishet) white, Western men who are wealthy‚Äîbenefit from privilege and have dominance.Anything that can be found (or close-read and interpreted into existence ‚Äì see also, discourse analysis) that is consistent in any sense with this presupposition of immanent oppression is then treated as ‚Äúevidence‚Äù not only that oppression is occurring but also that it is immanent (ordinary and hidden just beneath a nicer-looking surface ‚Äì see also, code and mask). The circular reasoning here is as obvious as the invitation to both confirmation bias and desirability bias.If oppression is anything that holds a demographic group down and this is understood to include vague, nebulous and subjectively interpreted manifestations of things like sexism and racism that are posited to always be present but difficult to see, it is hard to see how it can ever be overcome and won‚Äôt just continue to be detected in increasingly subtle and subjective ways. This is precisely what seems to be happening.Related TermsAbleism; Acting white; Active ignorance; Anti-blackness; Authentic; Aversive racism; Bias; Black feminism; Cishet; Classism; Close reading;

This necessitates the insertion of a false narrative which ties the ingroup to another, much older group which has history and traditions that they believe grant them credibility. Very often, this adopted tradition lacks any kind of coherent underpinning, grabbing from many different sources and treating them as part of a shared culture when no natural association exists.

Yes and no. Marx's writings, or what I remember of them, don't necessarily focused in developing a cogent plan for cultural elements for the conditions of communism or even as a criticisms of the capitalism of his time. He really was more focused on the economic/philosophic/historic conditions of the matter, but I'll leave that there as it is out of the topic. What I can believe is that the writers that were inspired by Marx's ideas like those of the Frankfurt School, Gramsci, Foucault, Said, Derrida, etc, etc. did write bodies of work that told those interested that culture and the elements which compose it are is as much of a battleground as anything else: Language, religion, traditions, forms of communication, entertainment, education, sexuality, and about anything else really, is a potential tool that is used or to be for purposes of instruction about ideology. If you like semantics I think that ""cultural Marxism"" is misnamed but it is an easy buzzword for people whose knowledge of communism is Marx and Stalin, so it makes at least some sense that it is what is called. That being said, the phenomenon itself I think is a bit of mix bag. The natural counterpoint of capitalism is communism and those of us who live in a capitalist country often hear any criticism towards it as nothing more than commie cultural Marxist propaganda. The US in general has been afraid of anything related to communism since at least the 1920's as it very much would fucking wreck the country (as it did most that adopted it), and the people are very much trained to react to anything with ties to Marx's ideas as communism. There are segments of the population that have just replaced Communism/Communism for Cultural Marxism/Marxist as it sounds more intellectual, but is often used as meaninglessly as the term was used through the Cold War to attack anybody left of Reagan. That being said, again, the current of though in much of the Western world has shifted left. Partly as a backlash against the states of the ""Right"" which were blamed for WW1 and WW2, and partly because of the rise of mass forms entertainment and communications which allowed certain artistic and scientific tendencies to be disseminated faster and wider than ever before. Those ""somewhat"" niche writers that inspired mostly academics and fellow writers have in these past decades found their ideas gestate into enough influence within the idea spreading circles that they have turned into policies or the unofficial pillars to build change around. As for myself, capitalism isn't great but it still the best.

Feminism, CRT, cultural Marxism: all the same shit - traditional way is bad bad so bad. A whole new language has arisen to support this. Words like Racist, Misogynist, Homophobe and the like have arisen to demonize ideas which predate the wheel. Ideas likepeople prefer the company of their own kindmen and women are differentgay people can undermine social cohesionwere understood for 100,000 years and practiced by every society until critical theory.So when you investigate that, you see that the modern left is in fact Semitic in origin, both philosophically (uniting the ideas of Freud and Marx is the essence of critical theory) and practically: Weil and Horkheimer, and later Alinsky, Steinem, Friedan, Julius Rosenwald, Soros etc. The leaders of the left have always been Jews. Politically, the loudest cheerleaders for the left are often Jews: Sanders, Schumer and in the past, Mr. Immigration himself, Jacob Javits. One need only look at the impeachment(s) of POTUS Trump to see how Jews feel about MAGA. In addition to Schumer, the leaders included Schiff, Nadler and Raskin....and of course Vindman. FYI Raskin's wife is a far left activist (Surprise!) that Sen Manchin is keeping away from the Fed.We see then that:the left is based on critical theory, which is revealed by its name: a critique of traditional social structures. (The Frankfurt school was a social theory school)The creators of this. philosophy and its leaders thereafter are mostly jews, certainly Jews are disproprotionally represented. This tracks with data showing Jews vote 8/10 (D).The only uncertainty is Rep Greene's opinions, which we can't be sure of. But many Christians seem to think Jews and Christians are all one big family and we'll all get on the same page when Jesus comes back. While this may or may not happen, Jews and Christians are far less spiritually aligned than Sunnis and Shiites, and how are they doing?So yes, Rep Greene might do well to investigate these things further and gain a deeper understanding of the actual battle lines, not the D-R theater which is the source of her popularity.",cant speak commenter seems pretty clear modern left based nothing implementing teachings critical theory imported us max horkheimer feminism crt cultural marxism shit traditional way bad bad bad whole new language arisen support words like racist misogynist homophobe like arisen demonize ideas predate wheel ideas likepeople prefer company kindmen women differentgay people undermine social cohesionwere understood years practiced every society critical theoryso investigate see modern left fact semitic origin philosophically uniting ideas freud marx essence critical theory practically weil horkheimer later alinsky steinem friedan julius rosenwald soros etc leaders left always jews politically loudest cheerleaders left often jews sanders schumer past mr immigration jacob javits one need look impeachments potus trump see jews feel maga addition schumer leaders included schiff nadler raskinand course vindman fyi raskins wife far left activist surprise sen manchin keeping away fedwe see thatthe left based critical theory revealed name critique traditional social structures frankfurt school social theory schoolthe creators philosophy leaders thereafter mostly jews certainly jews disproprotionally represented tracks data showing jews vote dthe uncertainty rep greenes opinions cant sure many christians seem think jews christians one big family well get page jesus comes back may may happen jews christians far less spiritually aligned sunnis shiites doingso yes rep greene might well investigate things gain deeper understanding actual battle lines dr theater source popularity,16,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

I know this since this is part of what i study about NWO for the last 20+ years. Don't be afraid to use the actual word we have in English which is ""pederast"" which is synonymous w/ child molester / rapist. It seems it was thechild molesters / rapists who deliberately did a bait and switch with ""pedophile"" to hide behind that word (pedophile actually means friendly love of boys/children in English before it was given a severe misnomer / corruption, nothing sexual/erotic, average Greek people know this hence why they wonder why English does not use the accurate word ""pederast"" - the ""erast"" part comes from ""eros"" [""erotic"" in English thus sexual etc] - using ""pederast"" is a sniper headshot).

If you have not already, highly recommend you reach-out to WDI-USA (Women's Declaration International) and/or Women's Liberation Front (WoLF) who are already engaged in US legal challenges to identity-politics and ideological-capture, and might be able to help, or at least make some referrals. (I will also send it to WDI International, in the UK, to pass onto other US members.)

Cultural Marxism,2022-07-05,19:56:39,tonylion,Disqus,https://www.mediaite.com/?p=5357148#comment-5908119181,"Excerpts from Dr. Lawrence Sellin Ph.D. article: The behavior of the modern Democrat Party is not without historical precedent. As Democrats continue their political march leftward, and lacking popular support, they have adopted the non-democratic tactics directly out of the Communist Party playbook. 
 After the successful 1917 communist revolution in Russia, the political left widely believed that a violent proletarian revolt would sweep across Europe and, ultimately, North America. It did not. As a result, the Communist International began to investigate other ways to create the state of societal hopelessness and alienation necessary as a prerequisite for socialist revolution, in essence, to erode Western democracy from within. 
 The single, most important organizational component of that effort was a Communist think tank called the Institute for Social Research in Frankfurt, Germany, popularly known as the Frankfurt School. When the Nazis assumed power in Germany, the Frankfurt School transplanted itself to Columbia University in New York City.The task of the Frankfurt School was first, to undermine the foundation of Western civilization that emphasized the uniqueness of the individual and, second, to determine new cultural forms which would increase the disaffection of and division among the population. 
 Just as in classical economic Marxism, where certain groups like workers and peasants are a priori good, and other groups like the bourgeoisie and capital owners are evil, in Cultural Marxism, feminists, racial and ethnic minorities and those who define themselves according to sexual orientation are deemed good and ‚Äúvictims‚Äù of societal injustice. It logically follows, then, that white males and ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù and, by extension, Western civilization, are automatically and irredeemably malevolent. Ergo, Critical Race Theory. 
 To many Americans, the Democrat Party promotes policies that undermine the United States as a sovereign nation, our Constitution, our culture, our traditions, all of what ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äù has come to mean. Part of that effort is to weaken our ability to transmit to the next generation the values and traditions upon which the United States was built. Ergo, the 1619 Project, the destruction of historical statues and the renaming of military bases. 
 Layered on top of the Democrat Party‚Äôs war on American culture is the Biden regime‚Äôs controlled demolition of the U.S. economy. The inevitable outcome of Democrat policies is a dystopia, characterized by a cataclysmic decline of a society, in which a totalitarian government enforces ruthless egalitarianism by suppressing or denouncing ability and accomplishment, or even competence, as forms of inequality. Ergo, the Biden regime‚Äôs ‚Äúequity‚Äù agenda. 
 Foremost among the Democrat Party‚Äôs dystopic policies is the eradication of the family as America‚Äôs primary social institution. Ergo, government-sponsored drag queen story hour for children and the promotion of transgenderism. In his article, ‚ÄúWhy Americans Are Not Taught History,‚Äù Christopher Hitchens, compared America‚Äôs present-day culture with the Democrat Party‚Äôs leftist utopian myth. 
 For the true blissed-out and vacant servitude required by the Democrat strategy, you need a society that lacks any sense of itself through an understanding of its own history and traditions. The low-information voter will submit to a combination of governmental coercion as in George Orwell‚Äôs ""Nineteen Eighty-Four‚Äù and the hedonist nihilism of a painless, amusement-sodden, and stress-free consensus managed by the nanny-state found in Aldous Huxley‚Äôs ‚ÄúBrave New World.‚Äù 
 The social chaos and extremism we are currently witnessing in the United States is the product of a well-funded and well-organized anti-American agenda, and a Democrat Party that enables rather than opposes the aims of our enemies. Ergo, Antifa, BLM and the Highland Park shooter.",excerpts dr lawrence sellin phd article behavior modern democrat party without historical precedent democrats continue political march leftward lacking popular support adopted nondemocratic tactics directly communist party playbook successful communist revolution russia political left widely believed violent proletarian revolt would sweep across europe ultimately north america result communist international began investigate ways create state societal hopelessness alienation necessary prerequisite socialist revolution essence erode western democracy within single important organizational component effort communist think tank called institute social research frankfurt germany popularly known frankfurt school nazis assumed power germany frankfurt school transplanted columbia university new york citythe task frankfurt school first undermine foundation western civilization emphasized uniqueness individual second determine new cultural forms would increase disaffection division among population classical economic marxism certain groups like workers peasants priori good groups like bourgeoisie capital owners evil cultural marxism feminists racial ethnic minorities define according sexual orientation deemed good ‚äúvictims‚äù societal injustice logically follows white males ‚äúprivilege‚äù extension western civilization automatically irredeemably malevolent ergo critical race theory many americans democrat party promotes policies undermine united states sovereign nation constitution culture traditions ‚äúamerica‚äù come mean part effort weaken ability transmit next generation values traditions upon united states built ergo project destruction historical statues renaming military bases layered top democrat party‚äôs war american culture biden regime‚äôs controlled demolition us economy inevitable outcome democrat policies dystopia characterized cataclysmic decline society totalitarian government enforces ruthless egalitarianism suppressing denouncing ability accomplishment even competence forms inequality ergo biden regime‚äôs ‚äúequity‚äù agenda foremost among democrat party‚äôs dystopic policies eradication family america‚äôs primary social institution ergo governmentsponsored drag queen story hour children promotion transgenderism article ‚äúwhy americans taught history‚äù christopher hitchens compared america‚äôs presentday culture democrat party‚äôs leftist utopian myth true blissedout vacant servitude required democrat strategy need society lacks sense understanding history traditions lowinformation voter submit combination governmental coercion george orwell‚äôs nineteen eightyfour‚äù hedonist nihilism painless amusementsodden stressfree consensus managed nannystate found aldous huxley‚äôs ‚äúbrave new world‚äù social chaos extremism currently witnessing united states product wellfunded wellorganized antiamerican agenda democrat party enables rather opposes aims enemies ergo antifa blm highland park shooter,0,3,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0

And to the extent a homosexual attempts to indoctrinate kids into their preferences, they should be barred from schools, too. I think Florida's law is a good start.

What really matters is whether they are 'pro-life' in the broadest sense. So the conservative 'libertarian' broad church should not include faggots like Dave Rubin, nor trannies like Blair White. The libertarian conservative lie is that you are an individual and it is alright to act in your own selfish interests, as Ayn Rand proposes. In reality, you should be free to act in the interests of the community (taxation/theft vs free-will charity). Liberalism/libertarianism is too often construed as a selfish 'I can do what I want' ideology. If the conservative or leftist/liberal state is a christian ethno state, that is a different matter altogether. There, if there is freedom, it is used by individuals to help your own society and people. With subversive jews and unfettered immigration of those who can never assimilate, then the picture becomes complicated. At that point, bar removal of said groups, small government conservatism is the better system IMO, since fuck giving money to help those groups ruin us. National Socialism worked so well because of the shared Germanic identity - a leftist big government ruling for your own people. There would be no thought of acting outside the interests of your group in this situation, unless you were influenced by subversive jewish ideologies such as communism ( divisive since it creates factions - workers vs elites and moving into divisve cultural Marxism).

 &gt;The Institute built up a cadre of cultural Marxists, including Max Horkheimer, Erick Fromm and Herbert Marcuse. When the Nazis came to power in 1933 the Frankfurt School migrated to the United States. There its members set about poisoning American culture, based in Columbia University. Theodor Adorno promoted degenerate atonal music to induce mental illness, including necrophilia, on a large scale. He and Horkheimer also penetrated Hollywood, recognising the film industry‚Äôs power to influence mass culture. The American schools system was a prime target for successful subversion.

We all know it isn't Joe Biden. Is Brian Deese actually calling the shots? Is he just a puppet for BlackRock and the New World Order?When Brian Deese, Director of the National Economic Council, famously referred to the ""Liberal World Order"" last week, conservative pundits and news outlets rightly jumped on the globalist reference. But what was missed by most is that Deese isn't just a Democrat true-believer in building back better and surrendering our sovereignty. He's a plant who ran BlackRock's notorious ESG program between his stints in the Obama and Biden regimes.Benny Johnson:'Guys relax ‚Äî $5 gas is a small sacrifice to make for the future of the Liberal World Order'On the latest episode of The JD Rucker Show, I dove into Deese's colorful history and discussed how BlackRock is doing more than just pushing for woke policies. They may be running the show at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and Deese is either their emissary or one of the people calling the shots.Deese started his political career as top economic advisor for the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2008. When she lost, Deese moved over to Barack Obama's campaign in the same role. He graduated from Yale Law School a year later while working for the Obama regime.Deese was appointed as a special assistant to the president for economic policy, serving in the National Economic Council before being named deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget in the summer of 2013.Following the departure of John Podesta, Deese took over his brief on climate and energy. Unlike Podesta, who served as Counselor to the President, Deese was promoted to the position of Senior Advisor to the President. In this position, Deese played an influential role in negotiating the Paris Climate Agreement in December 2015. Along with Katie Beirne Fallon, Deese helped to negotiate the 2015 Bipartisan Budget Act, which replaced the budget sequestration and increased federal spending by $80 billion over two years. In February 2016, the President tapped Deese to oversee the Supreme Court nomination process, which led to the President's nomination of Chief Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court on March 16, 2016.He joined the Biden regime and is now the 13th Director of the National Economic Council.So, what happened in the gap between his stints with the Obama and Biden regimes? He went to work for Blackrock in 2017 and left them, conspicuously, in December 2020, just in time to take his newly acquired New World Order marching orders into a high position with the White House.While with BlackRock, he was the Global Head of Sustainable Investing. Deese led BlackRock's Sustainable Investing Team which ""is focused on identifying drivers of long-term return associated with environmental, social and governance issues.""Yes, Deese ran BlackRock's ESG initiative, the destructive private component of the New World Order's plans to use public-private partnerships to usher in The Great Reset. Today, he's working both sides of that particular partnership. Is he a liaison or is he one of the shot-callers? It could go either way.ESG represents the most powerful tool the globalist elites are using to bring The Great Reset forward. While they rig elections and infiltrate governments to handle the public side of the public-private partnerships they envision, ESG is the tool through which to control the private side. They influence and oftentimes control major corporations through ESG, making companies beholden to their whims.The parallel's between the left's ESG and the fundamental values that drive many on the right are striking. They look to Environment, Social, and Governance as their battle arenas while we look to Religion/Faith, Culture, and Politics as arenas in which we fight the good fight. The parallels are clear once we examine what ESG really is.The ""Environment"" component is their religion. They worship this world, driving them to want to protect it at all costs. The ""Social"" component represents wokeness, or as it has been known as for decades, Cultural Marxism. This is how they intend to destroy families and make government supreme. Their version of ""Governance"" is not just through elected (or installed) politicians. They view The Great Reset's future as a technocracy through which public-private partnerships allow the elites to have unprecedented direct control over our lives.https://www.bitchute.com/video/kcrjEOU5YYFU/Read @ https://jdrucker.substack.com/p/revealed-brian-liberal-world-order",energycrisis economiccollapse esg nwo liberalworldorder briandeese blackrock obufu bidenharris democrats democratshateyourevealed brian liberal world order deese blackrocks esg plant biden white housewho really running white house know isnt joe biden brian deese actually calling shots puppet blackrock new world orderwhen brian deese director national economic council famously referred liberal world order last week conservative pundits news outlets rightly jumped globalist reference missed deese isnt democrat truebeliever building back better surrendering sovereignty hes plant ran blackrocks notorious esg program stints obama biden regimesbenny johnsonguys relax ‚äî gas small sacrifice make future liberal world orderon latest episode jd rucker show dove deeses colorful history discussed blackrock pushing woke policies may running show pennsylvania avenue deese either emissary one people calling shotsdeese started political career top economic advisor hillary clinton campaign lost deese moved barack obamas campaign role graduated yale law school year later working obama regimedeese appointed special assistant president economic policy serving national economic council named deputy director office management budget summer following departure john podesta deese took brief climate energy unlike podesta served counselor president deese promoted position senior advisor president position deese played influential role negotiating paris climate agreement december along katie beirne fallon deese helped negotiate bipartisan budget act replaced budget sequestration increased federal spending billion two years february president tapped deese oversee supreme court nomination process led presidents nomination chief judge merrick garland supreme court march joined biden regime th director national economic councilso happened gap stints obama biden regimes went work blackrock left conspicuously december time take newly acquired new world order marching orders high position white housewhile blackrock global head sustainable investing deese led blackrocks sustainable investing team focused identifying drivers longterm return associated environmental social governance issuesyes deese ran blackrocks esg initiative destructive private component new world orders plans use publicprivate partnerships usher great reset today hes working sides particular partnership liaison one shotcallers could go either wayesg represents powerful tool globalist elites using bring great reset forward rig elections infiltrate governments handle public side publicprivate partnerships envision esg tool control private side influence oftentimes control major corporations esg making companies beholden whimsthe parallels lefts esg fundamental values drive many right striking look environment social governance battle arenas look religionfaith culture politics arenas fight good fight parallels clear examine esg really isthe environment component religion worship world driving want protect costs social component represents wokeness known decades cultural marxism intend destroy families make government supreme version governance elected installed politicians view great resets future technocracy publicprivate partnerships allow elites unprecedented direct control liveshttpswwwbitchutecomvideokcrjeouyyfuread httpsjdruckersubstackcomprevealedbrianliberalworldorder,0,0,1,2,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

 OVERRATE:
 
 **1 - Abortion** \- Im social conservative ---- but I dont see any kind of impact in my personal life or society as a whole if the neighbor girl decides to have an abortion.
 
 AS the Texas law says, its better to leave this issue to the states.
 
 &amp;#x200B;
 
 **2 - Guns** \- I've never understood the fetish for this. 
 
 Yes the 2A and all that.... but guess what? having guns and AK47 etc etc have NOT prevented the left from owning most institutions and centers of power in the country, thus allowing them to engineer society as they please....so I find the devotion for weapons largely useless for political purposes. 
 
 Cling to your guns all you want , as Barack said, we are still in a society where liberals seem to dictate morals and values.
 
 &amp;#x200B;
 
 **3 Communism -**
 
 OK, meaning ECONOMIC communism ---- will NEVER EVER happen in the USA.
 
 If even Russia and China renounced it...
 
 Only backward, forsaken places like Cuba and North korea cling to it, and basically to keep the dictator in place.
 
 &amp;#x200B;
 
 UNDERRATE:
 
 **1 - LGBT** \- The right rolled over too easy, too docile to this. 
 
 Beyond the moral arguments, religious or NOT, it opened a whole Pandora box in which the whims of those people are given paramount importance.
 
 Should I mention the infringement of FREEDOMS OF CHOICE AND ASSOCIATION related to the fact that you CANNOT choose about entering in a commercial, business or even personal association with them?
 
 Because, rejecting them is ""discrimination"".
 
 And if I go to the real source of the problem, its the Civil rights law of the 60s. that demonized personal fredoms of association on the name of ""muh fictional equality"" and declared ""rights"" every whim of minorities, like a true ideological Trojan Horse.
 
 &amp;#x200B;
 
 **2- Cultural marxism**
 
 Now, this is the other side of the coin of COMMUNISM.
 
 Because, if you're informed enough, you know that Marxism, Maoism and Leninism ***werent just about the economy***
 
 They were movements intent on creating a whole new society, so they always had this... social engineering component.
 
 Things we are seeing now coming from woke people capturing institutions and imposing their/xer/them lunatic views on the rest of us.

So let's give a few highlights of the destabilized first third of the 20th century in no particular order: 1) With the advent of new forms of media (radio, telegram, TV), societal and political changes that used to take centuries now happen in decades. üëä) with the internet and smart phones, changes that used to take years now happen in weeks. 2) European powers do their best to appease Nazi Germany, an authoritarian expansionist regime citing security concerns of encircling powers and a moral duty to ""liberate"" its national kin. üëä) Putin denazifying by nazifying? 3) A nation across the pacific from the US that industrialized in unprecedented speed is becoming a naval super power projecting power over its neighbors. üëä) Is 2000's Communist China the new 1900's Japanese Empire? 4) Islamists rear their ugly heads as the Middle East is shred to pieces. üëä) 1900's - 1940's Wahhabism and the Muslim Brotherhood, and the political mess left by the demise of the Ottoman Empire. 5) Societal values in the West are pushed to the brink. üëä) The roaring 20's with a tame version of drag shows, Women Rights and Civil liberties the big thing. 6) The global world and naval power is slowly politically and economically declining as another super power across the ocean becomes the dominant industrial and economic power house. üëä) The USA overtaking the British Empire (though it will take a broken post World War economy and a bunch of successive lefti progressives to finalize the handover). 7) A demographic shock is up ending industries and social balance. üëä) deaths in WWI and a REAL pandemic left the world devoid of working-aged men. Now with consistently declining birth rates the Boomers are set to retire at mass. 8) An ""everything bubble"" bursts with no bottom support line in sight while governments try to print themselves out of trouble. üëä) Enough said. 9) New technologies completely revolutionize the way wars are fought (and won). üëä) Back then it was the Russo-Japanese and Crimean wars that showed us what's to come. 10) Globalization reaches a peak never seen before in human history. The huge volumes of world trade turn from growth opportunity to dependency leverages, and mass immigration is suddenly a thing. üëä) yeah, I know we're at 10 in the list, but you can dial this one up to a Spinal Tap 11, so let's just skip to 12. 12) Frightening political doctrines take over the academy and media (Stalin apologists are everywhere!) and the first instance of cultural Marxism hits the scene (the forefathers of Wokies). üëä) 1920's - 1940's: Antonio Gramsci and the Frankfurt School pave the way to the broken woke world around us. Today they dominate EVERYTHING, EVERYWHERE, ALL AT ONCE. 12) An authoritarian mass murdering regime (Lenin and Stalin) wages the first known instance of psyops meddling in the politics of Western powers. üëä) Stalin and Lenin couldn't have dreamed of the tools employed by China and their Russian pets.

Cultural Marxism,2022-09-23,4:40:34,Anonymous,8kun,,">>17562916 pbDutch Forum for Democracy members walk out on Thierry Baudets speechThierry Baudet is a Dutch author of 12 books and the founding director of the Forum For Democracy, a Dutch thinktank and political party.He is a member of parliament and a renowned public speaker.https://jermwarfare.com/podcast/thierry-baudet[Translation]The speech by which Baudet was deprived of the floor in the HouseForum for DemocracyChair,For years I have seen how our society is being destroyed and for years I have been fighting against that destruction.I fight against mass immigration, which is distorting our societies, causing crime, insecurity, social disruption and a catastrophic housing crisis;I fight against the EU's attack on our national democracies; that awful EU, which is sucking more and more power out of the public domain into a closed world of unelected bureaucrats;Against the climate hysteria and its catastrophic consequences, such as the current energy crisis that has in fact only just started and is likely to get much worse;Against the euro destroying our savings and our economy;Against the insane Covid policies, which have undermined not only our freedom, but also our health;Against wokism and its totalitarian attack on both freedom of expression and natural human relations;Against the ugliness, yes, the criminality of modern architecture, which violates life and makes everyone a stranger in their own country;And I also fight against the proxy wars of the US and NATO, as now, for example, against Russia, which was first provoked by that same NATO and which is now being fought on the territory of Ukraine: a war that is meaningless and unwinnable, and continent into chaos and poverty.Chair,For a long time I thought these were separate phenomena. I couldn't understand why new fronts were always being opened in the war against ordinary people trying to live an ordinary life. Why we were continuously brought further into the shit.I couldn't see the connection between these seemingly different problems.Then I came to realize that all these different insanities are really all part of a single plan. As irrational and counterproductive as they are (Covid policies, for example, arguably made Covid worse, all of these are part of the same Big Project.They are symptoms of the same spiritual error.This is not a secret conspiracy I discovered. It is instead an openly announced plan, or series of plans, that have one and the same underlying ideology.Whether the plan is called the Great Reset or Build Back Better, the Green Deal or the 'Euro-Atlantic Integration'; the plan is always the same and it comes from the same mindset, the same way of thinking over and over again.In the deepest conviction of the elites who rule us, human freedom is a danger; human nature is a danger. Indeed, human nature must be changed and a new man must be created.That's why they want transhumanism. These elites think that human nature is flawed and that the human intellect (that is, planners, like them) can improve it.They think they can live 150 years, or even forever. They think, like Yuval Harari, guru of the WEF, that people are ""hackable"" and can be programmed.They believe in ‚Äúhumanity 2.0‚Äù.Inextricably linked to this, these people hate existing individual freedom. They hate humanity 1.0, that is, real people.That's why they want fewer people on the planet.That's why they want to control us with social credit, QR codes and algorithms so that our feelings and desires can be monitored and manipulated.They think too many people travel. That a personal ‚Äúemissions budget‚Äù should control all our movements.They believe that freedom of expression should be curtailed because people say things they don't agree with.Yes, the whole politics of today has essentially turned into a struggle, a war against traditional European life, against the free man, against other opinions they call 'disinformation', against Russia of course, against even the seasonal flu, which they call excuse to inject people with poison, against national identities too, and yes, of course, against CO2, against Nitrogen, and so on.It goes on and on. The government model is war, because war means leaders can give orders to civilians, and that's what our elites really want.They think that the world would be more rational, better, more efficient, if it were organized in this way. By them!The language and ideology of top-down management and control thus dominates politics, and bears a stunning resemblance to the language and ideology of the Soviets. We used to have the planned economy; today we have the Sustainable Development Goals.But on a deep level, Davos' ideology is related to the ideology of communism. The apparent differences dwarf the similarities in conviction. In fact, from the Chinese model we see that communism is completely compatible with economic productivity and - indeed - with globalism.Thus, the political spectrum does not run from proponents of ""state interference"" on the one hand, and proponents of ""corporations and corporations"" on the other: for both groups, which on the surface could be called ""left"" or ""right"" on the other, are both groups in which the global elites could be classified: they both believe that when people are in line, they make the wrong choices. They believe that when countries are free, they start wars. And so, that they themselves, these global elites, have to rule.That is why our elites - from both the 'right' and the 'left' (thus indicating an insignificant, cosmetic difference indeed) - want to create top-down structures like that of the EU in order to make it impossible for states and people to and act of their own free will.Because of that ideology, it feels ""essential"" for them to want to regulate human economic activity down to the smallest detail and dream of total control over ""climate"" and ""planet"".Because of that ideology, it feels essential for them to pass euthanasia laws, such as those that already exist in the Netherlands, Belgium and soon France, because they no longer want to accept that there is a part of life that is completely out of our control.Just as much, it stems from the same ideology of our elites, that the LGBTQI madness is propagated and that children - young children! - are encouraged to experiment with deviant sexualities: nature must be adaptable, yes, the body is for them just an instrument to be brought under control, and the heterosexual family as a natural, even biological basis of society is a thorn in them in the eye.Also, because of that ideology, in which the members of our hopeless elites believe, an attempt is made to construct a new post-historic, post-national homo europaeus, without any connection to its homeland or its history, impregnated with a cosmopolitan ideology without roots.But that's why it's ""essential"" for our elites to destroy Russia, that's why this obsession with NATO's proxy war against Russia in Ukraine, because Putin's Russia evidently embodies the opposite of all these things.It is a country with a strong sense of national identity, with a realistic approach to foreign policy and a virile male leader against whom the effeminate, often sexually deviant politicians of the West stand out in stark contrast.Chair,In ancient times, Gnostics believed that knowledge was the key to eternal life. That the world, nature, could be recreated according to one's own idea. It is the old astray of the Tower of Babel; the pride of man as we speak is embodied by contemporary gnostics such as Yuval Hariri, guru of Davos, and, in its wake, by all those members of the global elites whose members of our government are again the executors, the subordinates.But this wrong path has indeed been around for a long time; it is the age-old struggle between grounded people, those who accept the limits that nature, biology, and God place on life; and the Gnostics, the proud, the alchemists, who want to become God themselves, and who in their overestimation and megalomania cause immeasurable damage - again and again - to life.Consider, for example, the French Revolution, based on the megalomaniac delusion that society must be destroyed in order to be recreated; a revolution that led to the first organized genocide in modern history.Or look at how the same idea then continued with the positivists of the early 1800s, who wanted a world ruled by industrialists ‚Äì just as the World Economic Forum advocates today.Then it developed into utopian socialism, with figures like Robert Owen and Louis Blanc building model societies‚Äîwhich failed, of course, because nothing right has ever been hammered out of the crooked wood of humanity.But still it was not defeated, because after that all the revolutionary socialism of Marx, Engels and finally the murderous rule of Lenin developed.And what happened next? Despite the artificial and superficial 'contradiction' between capitalism and communism, Marxism was very much alive in the West during the Cold War ‚Äì namely, in the form of cultural Marxism, which was rampant in universities, in trade unions, in the media and in the secret services. .Whole generations of Europeans were thus taught by Marxists, be they pro-Soviet or pro-Mao. A good example is St Antony's College, Oxford, where Sigrid Kaag her M.Phil. has done, and which is little more than a training institute for Western secret services - that is, for precisely the globalist elites who want to plan and control our lives behind the scenes.Well, those people, the heirs of this criminal ideology, which caused the French and Russian revolutions, and which transformed into cultural Marxism in the second half of the 20th century - these people set the agenda of modern globalism.Marx and Engels said, ""The worker has no land."" That was their ideal. Marx and Engels saw socialism as a weapon, in fact a means, to destroy the nation and the family. But essentially Marx and Engels were internationalists.Makeability thinkers.They hated the nation and the family because they are natural structures, arising from the essence of human nature, and thus cannot be the product of human planning.So when the Cold War ended, this ideology did not disappear from the world stage. On the contrary, the ideology of global markets has merged with the ideology of the regulated welfare state.We got Globalism, the diabolical form of government in which Big Business and Big Government merge.Globalism in other words, as the heir of capitalism on the one hand and communism on the other.Engels wrote: ""The disintegration of humanity into a mass of isolated, mutually repulsive atoms means in itself the destruction of all corporate, national, and even all private interests, and is the last necessary step towards the free and spontaneous association of people.""The old dream of the alchemists. Dissolve and let it solidify. Solve et coagula. Destroy to rebuild.Covid therefore also as an opportunity ‚Äì The Great Reset. Build Back Better. Every word out of Klaus Schwab's mouth is based on the assumption that human society is dangerously anarchic and that it must be centrally managed, directed, controlled, by a few major players operating on a global level.So that globalists are hostile to national sovereignty is not because they are for individual freedom and against the perceived authoritarianism of states. It's because for them sovereignty embodies the very freedom, and thus the unpredictability, that they can't bear ‚Äì because it gets in the way of their supposedly rational plans.Indeed, those plans had been eagerly pursued since the end of World War II.Thus, national coal and steel industries were dismantled and placed under central bureaucratic control.Thus, national markets were dismantled and an internal European ‚Äúmarket‚Äù was created under central bureaucratic control.European national currencies were dismantled and placed under central bureaucratic control.Covid was the ultimate (and perhaps planned) opportunity for the globalists to push this control further.Britain's Jaap van Dissel, Neil Ferguson, even openly admitted that he took inspiration from China, the world's largest and most terrifying totalitarian state, to introduce lockdowns in Europe.Indeed, the globalists love China because it embodies exactly that combination of capitalism on the one hand and totalitarian control on the other that they dream of. The unfree top-down state of China does not frighten the globalists, it fascinates them and they want to imitate it.Indeed, they love China as much as they hate Russia. Russia, which not only openly and blatantly disobeys them, but which itself represents an alternative model that they are therefore trying to destroy before people can come to admire it.One of the first sanctions the EU imposed was therefore also aimed at Russian media - imagine Europeans hearing the Russian side of the story!Yes, mastering the narrative is essential to continue to represent and propagate the virtual reality in which the globalists want us to believe. So they don't just want to control people's energy consumption, know and record their social interaction and thoughts, they don't just want the planned economy: they want the planned society; planned humanity.And what exactly is wrong with all this? Why not try to control the world? Why are the globalists wrong? Why is the Great Reset the greatest existential threat to human freedom and European civilization we have ever faced?Chairman: you will know them by their fruits.Our countries are drowning in debt.Inflation is destroying our savings at the rate of 10% per year. For years, economic growth has barely exceeded 1%, if at all. That means that people lose between 9 and 10% per year in income.The euro has fallen below 1 dollar after Mario Draghi said he would save it at any cost.Our debt burden is now so great that it can never be repaid.Trillions of debt has built up for our children to pay off, and our retirees are seeing their savings evaporate due to inflation.This inflation is theft ‚Äì theft of our assets by the governments and banks that control the money presses.This, therefore, is a spiritual struggle‚Äîa struggle to save the human mind from the ravages of its potential engineers.A struggle in which human nature is at stake.Where humanity is at stake.We must stop the mass immigration and stop the war against native Dutch and European peoples.We must dismantle supranational organizations and return to free cooperation between sovereign nation states.We need to free ourselves from Big Pharma, Big Capital and Big Tech.For the safety of current and future generations, we need sound money, not the EU's politicized Weimar currency.We need policies that favor families, as in Hungary and Russia.We must make peace with Russia, stop with the insane climate mysticism, the LGBT alchemy and the modern anti-aesthetics.We must save European civilization.And that is exactly what the Forum for Democracy program

The very idea that an individual has certain inalienable rights and liberties (heck, the very word liberty itself) is in contradiction to the idea that the individual be suborned to things like tradition and order. Granted, these ideas did not emerge out of the blue, but are instead a conscious decision the arose from the fact that the Founding Fathers shared a love of Classical Greece and Rome, and an awareness that the compositional areas of the United States were derived of very different folkways, religious systems, etc (read ""Albion's Seed"" for more info on that), and needed some overarching principles to guide them together as a nation lest as various small states they all hang apart to paraphrase Franklin. It wasn't so bad when we were a small mostly agrarian republic. You didn't like the community values of your neighbors or the bothersome tax collector? You fucked off West. Now, for a very long time, that hasn't been the case, and natural conservative starts off on the back foot when having to argue against a positive liberty, leading to the prioritization of defense of negative liberties. Given the raging bonfires turned trashfires of modernity and post-modernity and you have natural conservatives picking and choosing their battles, and seemingly losing all of them. In my eyes, and this is completely an opinion, the purge of the paleoconservative strain of thought from the Republican party that began with that closeted toff Bill Buckley and triumphed with Reagan's celebration of economic, cultural and foreign policy excess was gasoline on the slow burning fire of critical theory (my preferred term for what current mainstream conservatives call Cultural Marxism), is why we are where we are today. So, to ironically quote Lenin, ""What is to be Done?"" Well, I most certainly don't have a master plan, I'm just some fucking idiot on the internet who's read too many books and shitposts and I would be highly skeptical of anyone who claims to have a plan. I have some intuitions. First and most importantly, this is going to take time. If you're really focused on the next couple of elections, well yes, it seems like nothing at all will change, particularly if you're looking at the top. You need to look local first and extend outward from there. Like I said before, think decades, think generations. Get involved in your local institutions, all of them, not necessarily political. Change won't come from shitposting here or anywhere else. Next, know this long fight will have its setbacks and temporary compromises. Bismarck said ""Politics is the art of the possible."" If you give up working towards something because your end goal is currently impossible, it will always remain impossible, find that which is possible in that direction and work towards there, even if it seems like surrender at that moment in time. Be pragmatic. I voted for Trump both times even though on many levels I found him personally distasteful. One thing I did and still do admire about him is his own political pragmatism. Yes, in his oratory he was all populist sturm und drang, but when it came down to getting to work, he was a remarkably canny and flexible operator. Most of his failures to achieve much came from his own naivety about the way politics work, his apparent ADHD when it came to things that needed sustained attention and focus, and a dismaying susceptibility to flattery and fakers. Be pragmatic. If you can't have a true conservative, take the MAGAtard, if you can't have the MAGAtard, then take the RINO who will side with you when you have points of alignment, if you can't have that, then take RINO who isn't going to commit political suicide to sell out, if you can't have that, then take the DINO, if you can't have that, and you're like me in a deep blue state, then you vote for the crazed dangerhair who will fuck shit up for the mainstream Dems, so they spend their time infighting rather than dealing with conservatives. You're probably never going to get everything you want unless you run for office yourself, so just deal with compromise. That's life. Click to expand... 
 The problem is that conservatism, as a political ideology, has zero vision. Conservatism is merely the principle that social and political change should be incremental rather than disruptive and revolutionary, and that the changes should take into account various interests, costs, knock-on effects, etc. Conservatism is a failed political ideology, because it completely absolves its adherents of any responsibility to drive changes or come up with any vision for the future. A conservative wants no say in deciding what the direction of any change is going to be, so when the people in charge of change decide that the next phase is going to be getting rid of conservatives completely, all a conservative can do is sputter about principles. Conservatives have been expelled from every American institution, because conservatives decided it wasn't their job to decide who gets expelled from institutions. Trump got as far as he did, and was opposed by conservative leadership, because he is truly not a conservative in the deepest sense.

Cultural Marxism,2022-04-18,19:35:00,,Telegram,,"‚Äã‚ÄãüëÜüëÜüëÜread the beginning of the articleüëÜüëÜüëÜ
 
 the task of the frankfurt school was first, to undermine the foundation of western civilization that emphasized the uniqueness of the individual and, second, to determine new cultural forms that would increase the disaffection of and division among the population.
 
 just as in classical economic marxism, certain groups like workers and peasants are a priori good, and other groups like the bourgeoisie and capital owners are evil, in cultural marxism, feminists, racial and ethnic minorities and those who define themselves according to sexual orientation are deemed good and ‚Äúvictims‚Äù of societal injustice. it logically follows, then, that white males and ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù and, by extension, western civilization, are automatically and irredeemably malevolent.
 
 the democrat party now promotes policies that undermine the united states as a sovereign nation, our constitution, our culture, our traditions, all of what ‚Äúamerica‚Äù has come to mean. part of that effort is to weaken our ability to transmit to the next generation the values and traditions upon which the united states was built.
 
 thus, the need to import individuals with views like parag agrawal and the biden-promoted invasion of illegal aliens with no understanding or commitment to americanism beyond economic exploitation.
 
 aided by totalitarian parag agrawal and other big tech oligarchs, the democrat party‚Äôs assault on the first amendment is meant to narrow the range of thought in order to make independent thinking literally impossible because there will be no words in which to express those thoughts. it is accomplished through the systematic destruction of language as ‚Äúmicroaggressions‚Äù or endlessly repeating statements that are patently untrue, like the existence of more than two biological genders.
 
 the widespread political intolerance promoted by the democrats and their media allies is largely based on the essay ‚Äúrepressive tolerance‚Äù written in 1965 by herbert marcuse, an adherent of the frankfurt school.
 
 fred bauer, in his article ‚Äúthe left and ‚Äòdiscriminating tolerance,‚Äô‚Äù captures marcuse‚Äôs inverted logic and identifies the origin of the political intolerance presently practiced throughout the united states:
 
 ‚Äúmarcuse argued that, because of the radical repressiveness of western society, a tolerance for all viewpoints actually contributed to social oppression. a pervasive network of assumptions and biases implicitly privileges the viewpoint of the powerful, so that seemingly ‚Äòequal‚Äô presentations of opposite opinions actually end up benefiting the viewpoint of the powerful. in the light of this situation, marcuse made a rather cunning inversion (one that has been aped countless times since by cultural organs across the united states): the fact that society is so radically unequal means that we should be intolerant and repressive in the name of tolerance and liberty.‚Äù
 
 marcuse provided the basis for critical race theory and the equity agenda now being forced upon every american institution.
 
 the inevitable outcome of democrat policies adopted from the frankfurt school is the cataclysmic decline of society, a dystopia, the only condition in which a totalitarian, one-party state can exist.
 
 the policies of the democrat party are meant to be destructive. let democrats live in the dystopia they create. we don‚Äôt have to.
 
 the state of new california is attempting to separate itself from democrat party malfeasance. it is an example worth emulating throughout the country.

While marxists generally take a libertine view towards these things, most are not explicitly codified in Marxist texts or anything. Marx didn't write shit like ""do drugs, spread porn and import niggers"" but rather spread a view in which these things would not be opposed by things like religion or the existing states, which Marxism explicitly opposes. If you tear down religion, the traditional state and borders then these things are going to propagate. The USSR instantly legalized faggotry when founded for example, but then Stalin re-criminalized it.What you need to understand to get the full scope of this involves a lot of the period of the 30's and 40's, the Frankfurt school, the abandonment of marxism by the core jewish cadre and their subsequent switch to neoliberal globohomo-ism (sometimes referred to as ""cultural marxism"" which causes taxonomic problems).Extremely oversimplified: a bunch of the insincere kikes behind marxism who were using it as a tool to destroy the West realized it wasn't going to work, so they abandoned class struggle and moved to pushing degeneracy to tear down Western societies. There still exist genuine marxists to this day who are largely non-jewish and don't explicitly push degenerate shit like this, and even feebly fight against it (the people who hand-wave Idpol on /leftypol/, marxist political groups, etc). The jews have almost entirely moved on to this neoliberal woke-ism which pushes the things you listed. They're not truly marxists, but they were born from the disillusioned marxists who abandoned their marxism but not utopianism.Again, there's a lot more to unpack here, but this is a start.",thats bit complicated marxists generally take libertine view towards things explicitly codified marxist texts anything marx didnt write shit like drugs spread porn import niggers rather spread view things would opposed things like religion existing states marxism explicitly opposes tear religion traditional state borders things going propagate ussr instantly legalized faggotry founded example stalin recriminalized itwhat need understand get full scope involves lot period frankfurt school abandonment marxism core jewish cadre subsequent switch neoliberal globohomoism sometimes referred cultural marxism causes taxonomic problemsextremely oversimplified bunch insincere kikes behind marxism using tool destroy west realized wasnt going work abandoned class struggle moved pushing degeneracy tear western societies still exist genuine marxists day largely nonjewish dont explicitly push degenerate shit like even feebly fight people handwave idpol leftypol marxist political groups etc jews almost entirely moved neoliberal wokeism pushes things listed theyre truly marxists born disillusioned marxists abandoned marxism utopianismagain theres lot unpack start,6,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

 By exploits, you could interpret that as doing generally good things that are bold. The trucker protests for example.
 
 The reason why things are turning to hell is because the western world is being ideologically purged of dissent against cultural marxism. You know.. that thing that's trying to crush traditional beliefs like the benefits of 2 parent households, MLK's dream (a more recent one), and freedom of religion and expression.
 
 I don't know if ""works"" specifically refers to miracles. He didn't say ""anyone who believes in me will be able to do every single thing I have been able to"". I'm not saying you're absolutely wrong, but the potential is there. It's unsafe to presume either way, really. It could just be a metaphor for good deeds and good will being considered divine grace. You could argue that people do ""cast out demons"" and heal the sick in the modern day and that these are inherently good things... they're just easily explained by science rather than ""miracles"" in the modern age.
 
 The bible says all people are sinners in one way or another, and no one is perfect. Some may start off christian and deviate from the doctrine.. or some may have only ever pretended to go along with the religion as a social thing. Then there are those who are duped by evil politicians. The devil is commonly represented as a deciever, and lies are not always obvious, especially from practiced politicians and sophists. To claim that they all embrace it is pushing it... that presumes on intent of an entire group. Ask any lawyer at all how difficult intent is to prove.
 
 A lack of evidence is not proof of the contrary, and that's part of my agnosticism. I also don't believe religion is the only hope, but I do believe it can be some people's hope.

The problem is, however, that cultural marxism is far more insidious and cancerous than even regular old fashioned marxism, because it can NEVER stop.The second you start treating people differently based on their identity characteristics, you open the door for everyone else to bitch and complain and moan about needing special treatment as well. And the fact that they gave it to one, means they have to give it to others else their power is not legitimate.So what happens?First you might start with groups based on gender or race. It might just be men and women being divided, and then white/black/asian/latino etc.,Next, you have to represent the people of different nationalities and sexual orientations, and gender ""identities"". So it goes from black people being represented, to now needing to represent black females.But wait, there's more! What happens when black females get represented? Well, of course, the black female muslim transgender disabled lesbians need to be represented.What happens when they get represented though? The same thing of all races must be represented. Then it starts going down further rabbit holes, like hair color, height, personality type, people who prefer cats to dogs, people who don't like hotsauce, cancer survivors, people with teeth or people who have no teeth.That's the direction you start going down, which means you will not stop until you hit the ultimate minority - the individual. At some point, the only way you can be inclusive and represent everyone on the SCOTUS is to literally let everybody on the planet be a member.We can see, obviously, how insane and retarded this shit is. It leads nowhere good.Which is precisely why identity should NEVER be allowed to be a factor in determining peoples opportunities. We should NEVER even try to ""represent"" people like that.The job should solely be based on whether you are the best candidate. In the case of scotus, if you will be able to uphold the constitution the best.Being a black transracial latinx transgender disabled lesbian dog owning cancer survivor with a beard, has literally no bearing on whether you can uphold the constitution.

Cultural Marxism,2021-12-31,7:31:53,DaechiDragon,Reddit,https://reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rsc484/antiwork_is_anticapitalist/hqnnzi7/,"Thanks for your detailed reply and for not treating me like a crazy person. There‚Äôs too much of that on Reddit. Again I agree with your criticisms of capitalism and of corporations rotting democracy (and even people‚Äôs health - e.g. food lobbyists convincing people/organizations that sugar is a good thing) and I believe that there will always be greedy/evil people. I also wonder how different things would be if politicians and money were separated. Imagine if politicians were paid much more than they are now and were strictly forbidden for being close to private companies (and it was actually enforced) and anybody selling stocks before government policy was enacted was locked up, things would be better. If we had less regulations that help the rich fight off competition or get free government grants we would have a better capitalist society. The problem is that these corrupt fucks ignore their duties for money. 
 
 My worry is that the same will inevitably happen with communism, except those leaders have the army at their disposal, which Bezos fortunately does not have. 
 
 I also can‚Äôt get my head around equality of outcome. It doesn‚Äôt sit well with me. However, a part of what you described lines up perfectly with what I would like to see in society. A socialist country where your basic needs are met and you can stay at home and eat grapes (but you won‚Äôt have all the luxuries) and then if you want to work you can play the capitalist game and earn super cars, but that social safety net will be there if you want to take a break. Hopefully robots and UBI will make it happen. I just think we cannot remove capitalism altogether because I think it spells danger. And I certainly can‚Äôt tolerate the woke cultural marxism that‚Äôs going on. It‚Äôs truly destructive to society. And on another note I don‚Äôt understand how communism would work with a smaller government/less force. What I see coming our way now is more authoritarianism. 
 
 You and I both want the same outcomes for the people, but we have different ideas on how to get there. Anyway, I appreciate your post and I will remain open-minded to ideas because my opinions can always change.

  &gt;Cultural Bolshevism (German: Kulturbolschewismus), sometimes referred to specifically as art Bolshevism, music Bolshevism or sexual Bolshevism, was a term widely used by state-sponsored critics in Nazi Germany to denounce secularist, modernist and progressive cultural movements. This first became an issue during the 1920s in Weimar Germany, when German artists such as Max Ernst and Max Beckmann were denounced by Adolf Hitler, the Nazi Party, and other German nationalists as ""cultural Bolsheviks"".
  
 **[Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Marxism_conspiracy_theory)** 
  
  &gt;Cultural Marxism is a far-right antisemitic conspiracy theory which claims that Western Marxism is the basis of continuing academic and intellectual efforts to subvert Western culture. The theory claims that an elite of Marxist theorists and Frankfurt School intellectuals are subverting Western society with a culture war that undermines the Christian values of traditionalist conservatism and promotes the cultural liberal values of the 1960s counterculture and multiculturalism, progressive politics and political correctness, misrepresented as identity politics created by critical theory.

So, we're off to a great start in terms of high quality source material, but let's go on. It turns out your comment reports the data inaccurately.
 
 All quotes below are from the relevant [paper](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.147.6141&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf).
 
 ""**The table indicates that self-identified Marxists are rare in academe today**. The 
 highest proportion of Marxist academics can be found in the social sciences, and there 
 they represent less than 18 percent of all professors (among the social science fields for 
 which we can issue discipline-specific estimates, sociology contains the most Marxists, at 25.5 percent)."" (40)
 
 What qualifies somebody as a ""Marxist?"" Asking them ""how well, on a seven point scale ranging from not at all to extremely well, the labels described them"" with a 4 or above being qualifying them for the Marxist group. So you've got a whole bunch of people in the 18% who are really just saying, I guess I'm a bit Marxist in some ways. That could mean they agree with dialectical materialism as a form of analysis and generally has very little to do with ""cultural marxism"" or the Frankfurt School. Some people might just have thought ""I'm not really anti-marxist"" and selected the middle option, 4.
 
 Finally, Destiny is right that cultural marxism is used as a dogwhistle for neo-nazis. Others have made the point to you, but I'll add that the existence of real critical theorists in academia does not mean ""cultural marxism"" is not used as a right-wing dogwhistle.

So when he talks about any social progressiveness in this context, it includes liberals. It is not the I believe that they are, I'm trying to illustrate how his line of logic and rhetoric is a similar to how fascists call anything left 'marxist'. And that is how his rhetoric comes across, that it must be a marxist revolution, whether Peterson actually believes it or not. 
 
 You're misunderstanding me, I don't think ""being in opposition to woke is the same as fascism"", nor do I believe that the ""woke"" are post-modern neo-marxists. But Peterson clearly does, which, like I said, is how fascists have talked about their politico-cultural enemies, by amalgamizing them into a singular ""Cultural Marxism"". This isn't about my ideology, this is about Peterson's rhetoric.
 
 He does inevitably amalgamize any socially progressive activism into a marxist ""woke"" left. He catastrophizes critical theory and amalgamizes it with all ""woke ideology"". In regards to hierarchies, he *is* against the study of these social hierarchies in the context of how they interact, that's what critical theory is. He is against it because any study of the interconnections of social categories and systemic oppression is marxist and marxist = evil (his catastrophizing). His catastrophization of the left/marxism is paramount to his rhetoric and why people think he's a fascist! 
 
 (side note: Peterson is not talking about an alt-left, and I would personally say his catastrophizing is just not even equatable to criticisms of alt-right, who are openly fascist, since woke ideology does not ultimately lead to a marxist regime, unlike alt-right.)
 
 I'm saying he uses fascist rhetoric, so it's no wonder why people think he is a Nazi/fascist. Not that he is in fact a Nazi. I've never said he was a Nazi. I think his characterization of critical theory is absurd though.
 
 To me, in the context of truscum and tucute, it is like saying tucute ideology is over-the-top and ridiculous and will lead to communistic social collapse, so we shouldn't advocate for trans rights. Like, tucute ideology obviously has its problems, but that just isn't the reality, or the conclusion that should be drawn.
 
 In the same way that calling critical theory marxist and post-modernist (even though marxism is modernist, not postmodern) is not correct, it is wrong to say that Peterson is a 100% fascist. But if we can say that critical theory has marxist origins, which you have put into the debate and I've gone along with, we can say that Peterson's rhetoric has fascist origins. He has many fascist fans for a reason.
 
 This is all over the place, but anyway, I only really replied because your original comment was indignant and made it seem like anyone who thought he was a Nazi were absolutely crazy, and I wanted to illustrate that it is not that hard to see how people reach that conclusion. Like I said, you obviously disagree with even the notion that he uses fascist rhetoric, and that's fine, but I think he does, so that's that.",issue peterson calls progressiveness postmodern neomarxism talks social progressiveness context includes liberals believe im trying illustrate line logic rhetoric similar fascists call anything left marxist rhetoric comes across must marxist revolution whether peterson actually believes youre misunderstanding dont think opposition woke fascism believe woke postmodern neomarxists peterson clearly like said fascists talked politicocultural enemies amalgamizing singular cultural marxism isnt ideology petersons rhetoric inevitably amalgamize socially progressive activism marxist woke left catastrophizes critical theory amalgamizes woke ideology regards hierarchies study social hierarchies context interact thats critical theory study interconnections social categories systemic oppression marxist marxist evil catastrophizing catastrophization leftmarxism paramount rhetoric people think hes fascist side note peterson talking altleft would personally say catastrophizing even equatable criticisms altright openly fascist since woke ideology ultimately lead marxist regime unlike altright im saying uses fascist rhetoric wonder people think nazifascist fact nazi ive never said nazi think characterization critical theory absurd though context truscum tucute like saying tucute ideology overthetop ridiculous lead communistic social collapse shouldnt advocate trans rights like tucute ideology obviously problems isnt reality conclusion drawn way calling critical theory marxist postmodernist even though marxism modernist postmodern correct wrong say peterson fascist say critical theory marxist origins put debate ive gone along say petersons rhetoric fascist origins many fascist fans reason place anyway really replied original comment indignant made seem like anyone thought nazi absolutely crazy wanted illustrate hard see people reach conclusion like said obviously disagree even notion uses fascist rhetoric thats fine think thats,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0

It was a bad time and place to be a Jewish Marxist, as most of the school‚Äôs faculty was. So, the school moved to New York City, the bastion of Western culture at the time.Max Horkheimer¬†was a dedicated Marxist who helped to create what is known as Critical Theory through radical Marxism. In 1930 he joined with a Marxist study group, started by Felix Weil, which evolved into the Institute for Social Research and is now known as the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory. Critical Theory maintains that ideology (Christianity) is the principal ‚Äúobstacle‚Äù to human liberation‚Ä¶In 1934, the Frankfurt School was reborn at¬†Columbia University. Its members began to exert their ideas on American culture. It was at Columbia University that the school honed the tool it would use to destroy Western culture: the printed word.The school published a lot of popular material. The first of these was¬†Critical Theory.Marcuse would be the one to answer Horkheimer‚Äôs question from the 1930s: Who would replace the working class as the new vanguards of the Marxist revolution? Marcuse believed that it would be a victim coalition of minorities‚Äîblacks, women, and homosexuals.The social movements of the 1960s‚Äîblack power, feminism, gay rights, sexual liberation‚Äîgave Marcuse a unique vehicle to release cultural Marxist ideas into the mainstream. Railing against all things ‚Äúestablishment,‚Äù The Frankfurt School‚Äôs ideals caught on like wildfire across American universities. https://archive.md/wip/54cCP *https://www.thestandardsc.org/david-galland/the-birth-of-cultural-marxism-how-the-frankfurt-school-changed-america/This guy has a U.S. Stamp, and schools named after him: Columbia University and CommunismIn 1923 Paul Robeson received his law degree from Columbia. He turned from law to show business and was soon using his fame to promote and support Communist causes. In 1934 he went on a pilgrimage to the Soviet Union. In 1952 the Soviet government awarded him its¬†Stalin Peace Prize.

Cultural Marxism,2022-04-13,4:24:55,OrangeJuliusEvola,KiwiFarms,https://incels.is/threads/us-2022-mid-term-election.111256,"I think the difficulty in being conservative in the United States comes from the very origin of the nation, which was radical for the time. The very idea that an individual has certain inalienable rights and liberties (heck, the very word liberty itself) is in contradiction to the idea that the individual be suborned to things like tradition and order. Granted, these ideas did not emerge out of the blue, but are instead a conscious decision the arose from the fact that the Founding Fathers shared a love of Classical Greece and Rome, and an awareness that the compositional areas of the United States were derived of very different folkways, religious systems, etc (read ""Albion's Seed"" for more info on that), and needed some overarching principles to guide them together as a nation lest as various small states they all hang apart to paraphrase Franklin. It wasn't so bad when we were a small mostly agrarian republic. You didn't like the community values of your neighbors or the bothersome tax collector? You fucked off West. Now, for a very long time, that hasn't been the case, and natural conservative starts off on the back foot when having to argue against a positive liberty, leading to the prioritization of defense of negative liberties. Given the raging bonfires turned trashfires of modernity and post-modernity and you have natural conservatives picking and choosing their battles, and seemingly losing all of them. In my eyes, and this is completely an opinion, the purge of the paleoconservative strain of thought from the Republican party that began with that closeted toff Bill Buckley and triumphed with Reagan's celebration of economic, cultural and foreign policy excess was gasoline on the slow burning fire of critical theory (my preferred term for what current mainstream conservatives call Cultural Marxism), is why we are where we are today. So, to ironically quote Lenin, ""What is to be Done?"" Well, I most certainly don't have a master plan, I'm just some fucking idiot on the internet who's read too many books and shitposts and I would be highly skeptical of anyone who claims to have a plan. I have some intuitions. First and most importantly, this is going to take time. If you're really focused on the next couple of elections, well yes, it seems like nothing at all will change, particularly if you're looking at the top. You need to look local first and extend outward from there. Like I said before, think decades, think generations. Get involved in your local institutions, all of them, not necessarily political. Change won't come from shitposting here or anywhere else. Next, know this long fight will have its setbacks and temporary compromises. Bismarck said ""Politics is the art of the possible."" If you give up working towards something because your end goal is currently impossible, it will always remain impossible, find that which is possible in that direction and work towards there, even if it seems like surrender at that moment in time. Be pragmatic. I voted for Trump both times even though on many levels I found him personally distasteful. One thing I did and still do admire about him is his own political pragmatism. Yes, in his oratory he was all populist sturm und drang, but when it came down to getting to work, he was a remarkably canny and flexible operator. Most of his failures to achieve much came from his own naivety about the way politics work, his apparent ADHD when it came to things that needed sustained attention and focus, and a dismaying susceptibility to flattery and fakers. Be pragmatic. If you can't have a true conservative, take the MAGAtard, if you can't have the MAGAtard, then take the RINO who will side with you when you have points of alignment, if you can't have that, then take RINO who isn't going to commit political suicide to sell out, if you can't have that, then take the DINO, if you can't have that, and you're like me in a deep blue state, then you vote for the crazed dangerhair who will fuck shit up for the mainstream Dems, so they spend their time infighting rather than dealing with conservatives. You're probably never going to get everything you want unless you run for office yourself, so just deal with compromise.

There's progressivism and wokism which came from it. Progressivism's roots can be traced back to Hegel with the idea that morality has a rational basis and as we improve our rational thinking we get more moral; this means that the past must be less moral and we need to constantly become more and more moral.Wokism branched off from progressivism but put such an emphasis on identity politics that it became the prime value. I think wokism comes from internet groups where echo chambers refined their identity circle jerking.What DID come from the Holocaust is cultural marxism and other forms of Jewish neurosis. That's no longer the driving force behind what's going on. Even if you were to convince the public that the holocaust was greatly exaggerated it wouldn't suddenly cripple everything. The desire to prevent 'another shoah' isn't why people push for open boarders or wokism.

I bet you've never heard of Scholem, but I strongly urge you to read his works on Sabbatean-Frankism. Why is this fact so salient? Glad you asked. You see, the core of Sabbatean-Franksim revolves around two central ideas: only these two. One, ALL is permitted (rape, murder, sodomizing a baby, etc ... the most evil repulsive acts ... everything). Two, all is **inversion**. The second point is as dangerous as the first. It means that everything a Sabbatean says, it's the exact opposite that is meant. So, Marx, another vile Sabbtean, devised the most vicious and murderous political philosophy ever known: socialism/communism that has resulted in hundreds of millions of deaths (Mao, Pol Pot, Lenin, Stalin ... the list goes on). First, you entice the dumb goyim with the promise of earthly paradise, and then gruesomely torture them in gulags. The same goes for the Frankfurt School: when they push alleged ""critical thinking"", it's precisely the opposite that is implemented.

If you are a fan of Orwell, he repeatedly made clear we need to be custodians + purists of accurate, correct, precise and sound language since when we do not, we are contributing to turning English into ""fool/idiot speak"" + and what you saw in ""Idiocracy"" (if you saw that movie) which is what the left has been doing especially more so in the last 30 years or so. I know this since this is part of what i study about NWO for the last 20+ years. Don't be afraid to use the actual word we have in English which is ""pederast"" which is synonymous w/ child molester / rapist. It seems it was thechild molesters / rapists who deliberately did a bait and switch with ""pedophile"" to hide behind that word (pedophile actually means friendly love of boys/children in English before it was given a severe misnomer / corruption, nothing sexual/erotic, average Greek people know this hence why they wonder why English does not use the accurate word ""pederast"" - the ""erast"" part comes from ""eros"" [""erotic"" in English thus sexual etc] - using ""pederast"" is a sniper headshot). Look what Orwell had to state on these matters;
 
 In his important essay, ‚ÄòPolitics and the English Language‚Äô, George Orwell foresaw the corrosive impact of Socialist and Communist ‚Äúverbal purification‚Äù (read: hijacking and destruction of sound, precise, accurate intelligent language) of the life of mankind. He warned that:
 
 *‚ÄúIf thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought. A bad usage can spread by tradition and imitation even among people who should and do know better.‚Äù *
 
 Cultural Marxism a.k.a. political correctness is indisputably intellectual colonialism and mental fascism for the gendering of ‚Äúthought-crime.‚Äù

Cultural Marxism,2022-01-08,0:05:59,@dasrightarchive,Telegram,,"origin of ""woke capitalism""
 
 so-called ""woke capitalism"" is a product of leftist cultural hegemony (specifically in academia), elite conspiracy, and ""civil rights"" law.
 
 1. leftist hegemony in academia (and education in general) indoctrinates each new generation of elites, bureaucrats, and middle managers with ""woke"" nonsense ‚Äî see for example, the tumblr generation getting hr jobs at amazon. leftist views are also socially enforced via media, social media, etc. 
 
 2. elite conspiracy is self-explanatory: all major ceos and corporate leaders are members of globalist organizations like the council on foreign relations and bilderberg group. open the website of any major corporation and you'll find that its board of directors is full of cfr and davos goons. these types have been pushing leftist ideology for centuries; ""globalism"" and ""leftism"" are synonymous.
 
 3. all corporations are beholden to so-called ""civil rights"" laws that literally force them to ""go woke."" even if corporations aren't involved with shady globalist organizations, they still get spanked by the government if they do a heckin' racism.
 
 there is currently a convoluted marxoid-type theory in vogue on the right, which states that ""wokeness"" is a ""natural result of capitalism"" because capitalism is about ""removing barriers to consumption."" so, it's completely rational that mega-corporations would fund blm (a marxist terrorist organization), promote pedophilic ""drag queen"" story hours, and indoctrinate literal toddlers with transgender ideology.
 
 this theory makes no sense at all. 
 
 if ""wokeness"" is an inevitable result of capitalism, then why were corporations ""bigoted"" from the dawn of capitalism in the 16th century, until after the second world war? what caused these corporations to abruptly switch from being unironic ""white supremacists"" to supporters of black trans toddler lives matter?
 
 ""woke capitalism"" only arose after leftists had secured cultural hegemony and multiple generations had been brainwashed. woke capitalism is simply cultural marxism. james lindsay was 100% correct when he identified the progression of ""wokeness"" as leninism ‚Üí maosim ‚Üí western marxism ‚Üí ""neo-marxism"" (""wokeness"").
 
 ""capitalism"" is not an autonomous force. corporations shouldn't be viewed as special unique entities controlled by abstract wizardry, but as nodes of power that can be captured and controlled by ideologically-motivated parties, just like the media, academia, or judiciary.
 
 certain people use their capital to push globalist/leftist politics, as they have always done: engels was a rich factory owner, jacob schiff (a director of wells fargo and an architect of the federal reserve) funded the bolsheviks, and so on.
 
 currently, the world's largest 'asset management' firm (which is basically a company that manages funds for other companies and invests money on their behalf) is blackrock, with 9.5 trillion dollars in assets. the company is so big that bloomberg called them the ""fourth branch of the government.""
 
 blackrock's ceo, larry fink (who is an 'agenda contributor' for the world economic forum), follows a united nations policy called environmental, social, and corporate governance (esg). blackrock prioritizes investments in companies that are in line with the un's esg principles, which include: climate change, sustainability, diversity, human rights, and animal welfare. (aka: technocracy, white genocide, and veganism). esg functions as a ""woke"" social credit score that cuts companies out of the financial system.

If the allied soldiers could see what their supposed victory brought upon their nations, they would not have fought.Hitlers last speech:German Volksgenossen! National Socialists!Twelve years ago, when, as the leader of the strongest party I was entrusted by the deceased Reich President, Paul von Hindenburg, with the office of Chancellor, Germany found herself faced with the same situation internally as the one that today faces it externally.The forces of economic destruction and annihilation of the Versailles dictate led to a situation that had gradually become a permanent one-namely, the existence of almost 7,000,000 unemployed, 7,000,000 part-time workers, a destroyed farmers class, a ruined industry and a commerce that had become correspondingly prostrate.The German ports were nothing but ship cemeteries. The financial situation of the country threatened at any moment to lead to a collapse not only of the state but also of the provinces and of the communities. The decisive thing, however, was this: Behind this methodical destruction of Germany's economy, there stood the specter of Asiatic bolshevism. It was there then, just as much as it is there today.In the years before our assumption of power the bourgeois world was incapable of opposing this development effectively on a small scale, just as it is incapable of doing so today on a large scale. Even after the collapse of 1918 this bourgeois world had failed to realize that an old world was vanishing and a new one being born and that there is no use in supporting and thus artificially maintaining what has been found to be decayed and rotten, but that something healthy must be substituted for it. A social structure that had become obsolete had cracked and every attempt to maintain it was bound to fail.It was no different today on a large scale, when the bourgeois states are doomed and when only clearly defined and ideologically consolidated national communities can survive the most difficult crisis Europe has seen in many centuries.We were granted only six years of peace after jan 30, 1933. During these six years tremendous feats were achieved, and even greater ones were planned, so many and such huge ones that they caused envy among our democratic impotent neighbors. But this was decisive: That we succeeded during these six years, with superhuman exertions, to restore the German nation militarily - that is, to imbue it with the spirit of resistance and self-assertion rather than to equip it with a material war potential.The horrid fate that is now taking shape in the east and that exterminates hundreds of thousands in the villages and the market places, in the country and in the cities will be warded off in the end and mastered by us, with the utmost exertion and despite all setbacks and hard trials. But if this is possible at all, it is only because a change has taken place in the German people since 1933.It is hardly necessary to argue with those eternal blockheads who maintain that an unarmed Germany would, owing to its impotence, not have become the victim of this jewish international world plot. Since when does the fox not kill the defenseless goose just because the goose is not aggressive by nature, and since when does a wolf become a pacifist because sheep do not wear armor? If there are still bourgeois states who earnestly believe this, that only proves how necessary it was to do away with an era that by its educational system managed to cultivate and maintain such notions, nay, even granted them political influence.The fight against this jewish asiatic bolshevism had been raging long before National Socialism came into power. The only reason why it had not already overrun Europe during the years 1919-20 was that it was then itself too weak and too poorly armed. It's attempt to eliminate Poland was not abandoned because of its compassion for the Poland of that time but only because the lost battle before Warsaw. It's intention to annihilate Hungary was not discarded because they changed their minds, but because bolshevist power could not be maintained militarily. Nor was the attempt to smash Germany given up because this achievement was not desired but because it proved impossible to overcome the natural resistance stamina of our people.Thereupon Judaism began systematically to undermine our nation from within, and it found its best ally in those narrow-minded bourgeois who would not recognize that the era of a bourgeois world is ended and will never again return, that the epoch of unbridled economic liberalism has outlived itself and can only lead to its self-destruction and, above all, that the great tasks of our time can be mastered only under an authoritarian coordination of natural strength, based on the law of same rights for all and, thence, of same duties. On the other hand, the fulfillment of the same duties must necessarily entail an equality of rights. Thus National Socialism, in the midst of gigantic economic, social and cultural reconstruction work has also educationally given to the German people that armor without which no military values can be created.The power of resistance of our nation has grown so tremendously since Jan 30, 1933, that it can no longer be compared with the earlier epoch, this power of resistance is the surest guarantor of the final victory. If Europe today finds itself the victim of a serious illness, then the affected countries will either have to overcome it by summoning their entire and utmost power of resistance, or they will be doomed. Yet the convalescent and survivor overcomes the climax of such an illness only in a crisis, a crisis that utterly weakens him, but in spite of all, it is all the more our immutable will not to shrink from anything in this struggle to rescue our people from this most gruesome fate of all time, and to obey steadfastly and the commandment of the preservation of our nation.The fact that this defense is fraught with incalculable misery, suffering and hardships makes us even more attached this nation. But it also gives us that hard will needed to fulfill our duty even in the most critical struggle; that is, not only to fulfill our duty toward the decent, noble Germans, but also our duty toward those few men without honor who divorce themselves from their people. In this fateful battle there is therefore for us but one command: He who fights honorably can thus save his own life and the lives of his loved ones. But he who, because of cowardice or lack of character, turns his back on the nation, will under any circumstance die a shameful death.That National Socialism succeeded in awakening and strengthening this spirit in our German people is a great achievement. Only when this mighty international drama will have died away and the bells of peace are ringing will realization come of what the German people owes to this spiritual rebirth: No less than its existence in this world.Only a few months and weeks ago allied statements openly outlined the German fate. Thereupon they were warned by some newspapers to be more intelligent and rather to promise something, even though nobody intended to keep this promise later. As a relentless National Socialist and fighter for my people, I now wish to assure these statesmen once and for all that every attempt at influence National Socialist Germany through slogans, lies and distortions presupposes a simple-mindedness unknown to the Germany of today.The fact that political activities and lies are inextricably linked in a democracy is of no consequence. Decisive is that every promise given by these statements to a people is today quite meaningless, because they are not in a position ever to fulfill any such promise. This is as if one sheep promised another sheep to protect it against a tiger.I herewith repeat my prophecy:England will not only not be in a position to control bolshevism but her development will unavoidably evolve more and more toward the symptoms of this destructive disease. The democracies are unable to rid themselves now of the forces they summoned from the steppes of asia. All the small European nations, who capitulated, confident of allied assurances, are facing complete annihilation. It is entirely uninteresting whether this fate will befall them a little earlier or later; what counts is its implacability.The kremlin jews are motivated only by tactical considerations; whether in one case they act with immediate brutality or, in another case, with some reticence, the result will always be the same. Germany, however, shall never suffer this fate. The guarantor thereof is the victory achieve twelve years ago within our country. Whatever our enemies may come up with, whatever sufferings they may cause on our German cities, on German landscapes, and above all, on our people, all that cannot bear any comparison with the irreparable misery, the tragedy that would befall us if the plutocratic-bolshevik conspiracy were victorious.Therefore, it is all the more necessary on this twelfth anniversary of the rise to power to strengthen heart more than ever before and to harden oneself in the sacred resolve to take up arms, no-matter where and under what circumstances, until final victory crowns our efforts.On this day I do not want to leave any doubt about something else. Against an entire hostile world I once chose my road, according to my inner call, and strode it, as an unknown and nameless man, to final success; often they reported I was dead and always they wished I were, but in the end I remained victor in spite of all.My life today is with an equal exclusiveness determined by the duties incumbent on me. Combined, they are but one: To work for my people and to fight for it. Only He can relieve me of this duty who called me to it. It was Providence's hands to eliminate me through the bomb that exploded only one and a half meters from me on July 20, and thereby terminate my life's work. In the years to come I shall continue on this road, uncompromisingly safeguarding my people's interests, oblivious to all misery and danger, and filled with the holy conviction that God the Almighty will not abandon him who wanted nothing other all his life than to spare his people from a fate it had never deserved neither by virtue of its number nor by way of its importance.I therefore now appeal to the entire German people and to my old fellow-fighters and to all the soldiers to gird themselves with a yet greater, harder spirit of resistance, until we can again-as we did before- put on the graves of the dead of this enormous struggle a wreath inscribed with the words: ""AND YET YOU WERE VICTORIOUS."" I expect every German to do his duty to the last and that he be willing to take upon himself every sacrifice he will be asked to make; I expect of every healthy man that he risk life and limb in this battle. I expect the sick and the weak or those otherwise unavailable for military duty to work with their last strength; I expect city dwellers to forge the weapons for this struggle and I expect the farmer to supply the bread for the soldiers and workers of this struggle by imposing restrictions upon himself; I expect all women and girls to continue supporting this struggle with utmost fanaticism.In this appeal I particularly address myself to the German youth. By forming such a committed community, we have the right to step before the almighty and ask Him for His mercy and blessings. No people can do more than that everybody who can fight, fights, and that everybody who can work, works, and that they all sacrifice in common, filled with but one thought: to secure freedom, national honor and thus the future of life.No matter how grave the crisis may be at this moment, we will overcome it in the end, in spite of everything, thanks to our unchangeable will, our readiness to sacrifice, and our abilities.

Cultural Marxism,2022-09-07,14:13:43,dislesickmick,Minds,https://www.minds.com/newsfeed/1414251714751500301,"Social Justice UsageSource: King, M. (2021, July 7). Could a School-Board Fight Over Critical Race Theory Help Turn Virginia Red? Retrieved July 9, 2021 The politics of this one school district have big implications for political control of Virginia. And Republicans hope to leverage this issue to wrest away Democrats‚Äô control of all three branches of state government. Last week, GOP candidate Glenn Youngkin even held a campaign rally in front of the Loudoun County school board building to decry critical race theory‚Äîeven as the school board repeatedly denies teaching it. (Nor is it taught in school districts around the country where conservatives are attempting to ban it.)Yet commonwealth Democrats have largely dismissed their efforts. In an early June press gaggle, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Terry McAuliffe dismissed the conservative uproar over critical race theory as a ‚Äúright-wing conspiracy.‚ÄùNew Discourses CommentaryGenerally speaking, a ‚Äúconspiracy theory‚Äù is an explanation for a phenomenon that attributes the cause of that phenomenon to a conspiracy of powerful (usually political) operatives with malevolent intentions when other explanations are more likely. In the Theory of Critical Social Justice, ‚Äúconspiracy theory‚Äù is generally used in this way but applied to essentially anything that might discredit it, its operation, or its intellectual and activist precursors. The objective in calling or linking anything opposing Critical Social Justice a ‚Äúconspiracy theory‚Äù is to discredit all opposition by making it look like something only a crazy, unrealistic person could believe. In turn, advocates of Critical Social Justice aim to make their position and worldview appear to be the only sane explanation for phenomena in the world.For example, the Wikipedia entry for ‚ÄúCultural Marxism‚Äù was entirely replaced with an entry titled ‚ÄúCultural Marxism conspiracy theory‚Äù to hide the fact that Cultural Marxism really was an attempt by an organized political think tank (the neo-Marxist Frankfurt School of Critical Theory) to undermine Western civilization and liberal democratic republics in favor of something like communism (see also, socialism, liberationism, and equity). Obviously, having people understand Cultural Marxism (i.e., Gramscian thought), neo-Marxism, or Critical Theory as central to the academic, intellectual, and activist roots of Critical Social Justice (i.e., ‚ÄúWoke‚Äù) ideology would be damaging to its attempt to insinuate itself into Western society, which is generally resistant to Marxism specifically and other strains of Marxian thought more generally.Another example is that all public opposition to Critical Race Theory is (at the time of this writing) being framed as a conspiracy theory maintained by conservatives who allegedly do not want the teaching of ‚Äúhonest history‚Äù (see also, revisionism), preferring a ‚Äúwhitewashed‚Äù version that doesn‚Äôt incorporate Critical Race Theory (which, paradoxically, the same people say isn‚Äôt being taught in schools anyway). The claim is that, although Critical Race Theory (and other Critical Pedagogy) are claimed to be necessary elements in our schools, it is a conspiracy theory by conservatives that they‚Äôre being pushed into the schools to advance the neo-Marxist agenda they explicitly embrace (see, for example, Alison Bailey on this, p. 6). The objective of this blatantly dishonest rhetorical maneuver (see also, pseudo-reality) is to discredit opposition to Critical Race Theory and Critical Pedagogy in the schools by making it into the sort of stuff only kooks and cranks could believe. A significant media push even emerged alleging that such pushback against Critical Race Theory is part of the ‚ÄúQ-Anon‚Äù conspiracy theory, which is grotesquely misrepresentative of reality.Interestingly, Critical Theory itself in general‚Äîand particularly Critical Race Theory‚Äîis a conspiracy theory, according to the generally accepted definition. According to Critical Theory, the powerful interests in society effectively brainwash the entire population into accepting their own misery and servitude without even realizing it (see also, false consciousness, internalized domination, and internalized oppression). In Woke Critical Theory (the Theory of Critical Social Justice, or critical constructivism, or applied postmodernism), which has adopted certain elements of postmodern social constructivism, this conspiracy theory is deepened by their beliefs in the relationship between language, knowledge, and power and by postmodern theories of power, such that now people are, without their realization, socialized into accepting the status quo by the very machinations of society itself in all of its operations (‚Äúthe system‚Äù) and they seek to maintain a kind of willful ignorance of this fact so that the existing order might be maintained. This is set by and for those who enjoy privilege in the systemic power dynamics that are said to order society (see also, superstructure). In this situation, all power dynamics in society work like a giant conspiracy theory in which everyone is a conspirator, usually unwittingly, unless they have been awakened to a critical consciousness (i.e., become a Critical Theorist).In Critical Race Theory, this is taken even further, particularly through three beliefs, two of which are core to the Theory and a third which is adopted from the so-called ‚ÄúCritical Philosophy of Race‚Äù (which Critical Race Theory purists insist has little or nothing to do with Critical Race Theory). The first of these is the belief that racism is the ordinary state of affairs in society, i.e., that systemic racism is the fundamental organizing principle of society and that everyone is effectively socialized into maintaining and reproducing this racial order until they awaken to a racial critical consciousness. Indeed, whiteness, under this doctrine, is posited to contain anti-Blackness as a key element.much more in link: https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-conspiracy-theory/",social justice usagesource king july could schoolboard fight critical race theory help turn virginia red retrieved july politics one school district big implications political control virginia republicans hope leverage issue wrest away democrats‚äô control three branches state government last week gop candidate glenn youngkin even held campaign rally front loudoun county school board building decry critical race theory‚äîeven school board repeatedly denies teaching taught school districts around country conservatives attempting ban ityet commonwealth democrats largely dismissed efforts early june press gaggle democratic gubernatorial nominee terry mcauliffe dismissed conservative uproar critical race theory ‚äúrightwing conspiracy‚äùnew discourses commentarygenerally speaking ‚äúconspiracy theory‚äù explanation phenomenon attributes cause phenomenon conspiracy powerful usually political operatives malevolent intentions explanations likely theory critical social justice ‚äúconspiracy theory‚äù generally used way applied essentially anything might discredit operation intellectual activist precursors objective calling linking anything opposing critical social justice ‚äúconspiracy theory‚äù discredit opposition making look like something crazy unrealistic person could believe turn advocates critical social justice aim make position worldview appear sane explanation phenomena worldfor example wikipedia entry ‚äúcultural marxism‚äù entirely replaced entry titled ‚äúcultural marxism conspiracy theory‚äù hide fact cultural marxism really attempt organized political think tank neomarxist frankfurt school critical theory undermine western civilization liberal democratic republics favor something like communism see also socialism liberationism equity obviously people understand cultural marxism ie gramscian thought neomarxism critical theory central academic intellectual activist roots critical social justice ie ‚äúwoke‚äù ideology would damaging attempt insinuate western society generally resistant marxism specifically strains marxian thought generallyanother example public opposition critical race theory time writing framed conspiracy theory maintained conservatives allegedly want teaching ‚äúhonest history‚äù see also revisionism preferring ‚äúwhitewashed‚äù version doesn‚äôt incorporate critical race theory paradoxically people say isn‚äôt taught schools anyway claim although critical race theory critical pedagogy claimed necessary elements schools conspiracy theory conservatives they‚äôre pushed schools advance neomarxist agenda explicitly embrace see example alison bailey p objective blatantly dishonest rhetorical maneuver see also pseudoreality discredit opposition critical race theory critical pedagogy schools making sort stuff kooks cranks could believe significant media push even emerged alleging pushback critical race theory part ‚äúqanon‚äù conspiracy theory grotesquely misrepresentative realityinterestingly critical theory general‚äîand particularly critical race theory‚äîis conspiracy theory according generally accepted definition according critical theory powerful interests society effectively brainwash entire population accepting misery servitude without even realizing see also false consciousness internalized domination internalized oppression woke critical theory theory critical social justice critical constructivism applied postmodernism adopted certain elements postmodern social constructivism conspiracy theory deepened beliefs relationship language knowledge power postmodern theories power people without realization socialized accepting status quo machinations society operations ‚äúthe system‚äù seek maintain kind willful ignorance fact existing order might maintained set enjoy privilege systemic power dynamics said order society see also superstructure situation power dynamics society work like giant conspiracy theory everyone conspirator usually unwittingly unless awakened critical consciousness ie become critical theoristin critical race theory taken even particularly three beliefs two core theory third adopted socalled ‚äúcritical philosophy race‚äù critical race theory purists insist little nothing critical race theory first belief racism ordinary state affairs society ie systemic racism fundamental organizing principle society everyone effectively socialized maintaining reproducing racial order awaken racial critical consciousness indeed whiteness doctrine posited contain antiblackness key elementmuch link httpsnewdiscoursescomtftwconspiracytheory,0,1,4,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0

Cultural Marxism,2022-07-09,0:11:48,shaun_waugh,Minds,,"Every form of education that aims to raise critical consciousness in state schools and universities is a violation of the principle of ‚Äòseparation of church and state‚Äô, and the case that New Zealand is having established a Marxian ideology mashed up with a very superstitious Polynesian cosmology and animism as a state religion is very easily made. New Zealand has hitherto been a secular State with no State religion, in which the separation between religious and democratic structures are now being systematically eroded. In legislation and policy, the State was establishing to respect freedom of thought, conscience and religion. There have historically been few constraints on the freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs. This is being undermined on purpose by white left progressives and Maori nationalist Race Marxists forging an apartheid state on neo-tribal grounds. Central to their social constructivist endeavour is the installation of a state religion, or belief system, that‚Äôs a hybrid of an identity political Marxian ‚Äúprivilege and oppression‚Äù heirarchy fight and a manufactured animist Polynesian cosmology. Critical pedagogy assumes a particular ""conception of man and the world"" that gives rise to clear duties of conscience (in both beliefs and activism). This is specifically what the prohibition of the state from establishing a religion is supposed to do. They get it in under the rug (and admit it) using this trick. The trick, which even people on the right fall for and endorse, even in the anti-Woke space, is that *every* educational practice assumes a theory of man and the world (and thus particular values), so theirs must be allowed as well. This is the deceit enabling the violation of separation of the state and any belief system be it religious or secular, such as cultural Marxism. Liberalism (classical English Liberal philosophy) assumes a *minimal* concept of man and the world (the world exists, is knowable, and man has at least enough reason to know something of it). This is self-evident. It's not a theology or meta-philosophy equipped with values and duties. The democratic principle of separation of church and state exists to prevent the state from establishing any particular concept of man and the world beyond that minimal self-evident core (because it's rooted in the humility of knowing that we're not God and thus can't know the full nature of God, life, etc) The separation of church and state would prevent the intentional establishment of the Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, Polynesian animist cosmology or even the Marxist concept of man and the world in specific. It has even done so for secular humanism. This should apply to the Polynesian cosmology and its animist superstitions, vitalism and ancestor worship, and its concept of man and the world, and also the Marxist concept of man and the world too but doesn't yet. The critical pedagogy of intersectional Feminism/leftwing progressivism by way of its Critical Theories‚ÄîPatriarchy Theory, Critical Race Theory, Queer Theory etc‚Äîthis secular ideology and its doctrine are a belief system that is quasi-religious. The critical consciousness that critical pedagogy fosters and encourages exists to awaken and explicitly assume a concept of man and the world, which develops dialectically‚Äîthrough the art of debating, refuting and arguing‚Äîto be manifested on society through man‚Äôs transforming action in the reflective putting into practice of a particular view of subject and object to fulfill or recollect man‚Äôs true nature, etc. It is not possible‚Äîto paraphrase the Brazilian educator and philosopher who was a leading advocate of critical pedagogy Paulo Freire‚Äîto have a critical consciousness without this concept of man and the world because critical consciousness means being aware of this concept and the duties of conscience it implies. Thereby critical pedagogy is an unambiguous form of Marxian secular religion. As such the installation of critical pedagogy in our education system is an unambiguous violation of the principle of the state not engaging in the establishment of a state religion. It has to stop. Culturally Relevant Teaching, Critical Race Theory, Queer Theory, Liberated Ethnic Studies, Transformative Social-Emotional Learning, etc etc etc, all explicitly state their location in the critical pedagogy concept and say they seek to raise critical consciousness. All of them. Critical pedagogy in all its forms in state schools and universities is a violation of the foundation principles of New Zealand‚Äôs secular democracy. It has to go.

Putin, the gloablists, and Xi all want to expand their influence so they can lord over the peasants (that's us).There's a lot of Putin support because he's not the one trying to give hormones to your children and banning you from society if you don't take a vaccine (although if you lived in Russia, he'd gladly conscript your children to war, or have you disappear if you were a problem). His intelligence services do encourage cultural marxism here because it weakens the west. So does China.In addition to the huge astroturfing of Ukrainian support, it's also natural for people to support Ukraine here because everyone loves an underdog, and they have been fighting as well as could be expected.What we need to do first is avoid entering this war. I don't care if Ukraine falls. Europe can wake up and defend themselves. Russia intends to eventually absorb Finland and replace America as the dominant influence in Europe, mostly through diplomatic and economic means.

Feminism, CRT, cultural Marxism: all the same shit - traditional way is bad bad so bad. A whole new language has arisen to support this. Words like Racist, Misogynist, Homophobe and the like have arisen to demonize ideas which predate the wheel. Ideas likepeople prefer the company of their own kindmen and women are differentgay people can undermine social cohesionwere understood for 100,000 years and practiced by every society until critical theory.So when you investigate that, you see that the modern left is in fact Semitic in origin, both philosophically (uniting the ideas of Freud and Marx is the essence of critical theory) and practically: Weil and Horkheimer, and later Alinsky, Steinem, Friedan, Julius Rosenwald, Soros etc. The leaders of the left have always been Jews. Politically, the loudest cheerleaders for the left are often Jews: Sanders, Schumer and in the past, Mr. Immigration himself, Jacob Javits. One need only look at the impeachment(s) of POTUS Trump to see how Jews feel about MAGA. In addition to Schumer, the leaders included Schiff, Nadler and Raskin....and of course Vindman. FYI Raskin's wife is a far left activist (Surprise!) that Sen Manchin is keeping away from the Fed.We see then that:the left is based on critical theory, which is revealed by its name: a critique of traditional social structures. (The Frankfurt school was a social theory school)The creators of this. philosophy and its leaders thereafter are mostly jews, certainly Jews are disproprotionally represented. This tracks with data showing Jews vote 8/10 (D).The only uncertainty is Rep Greene's opinions, which we can't be sure of. But many Christians seem to think Jews and Christians are all one big family and we'll all get on the same page when Jesus comes back. While this may or may not happen, Jews and Christians are far less spiritually aligned than Sunnis and Shiites, and how are they doing?So yes, Rep Greene might do well to investigate these things further and gain a deeper understanding of the actual battle lines, not the D-R theater which is the source of her popularity.",cant speak commenter seems pretty clear modern left based nothing implementing teachings critical theory imported us max horkheimer feminism crt cultural marxism shit traditional way bad bad bad whole new language arisen support words like racist misogynist homophobe like arisen demonize ideas predate wheel ideas likepeople prefer company kindmen women differentgay people undermine social cohesionwere understood years practiced every society critical theoryso investigate see modern left fact semitic origin philosophically uniting ideas freud marx essence critical theory practically weil horkheimer later alinsky steinem friedan julius rosenwald soros etc leaders left always jews politically loudest cheerleaders left often jews sanders schumer past mr immigration jacob javits one need look impeachments potus trump see jews feel maga addition schumer leaders included schiff nadler raskinand course vindman fyi raskins wife far left activist surprise sen manchin keeping away fedwe see thatthe left based critical theory revealed name critique traditional social structures frankfurt school social theory schoolthe creators philosophy leaders thereafter mostly jews certainly jews disproprotionally represented tracks data showing jews vote dthe uncertainty rep greenes opinions cant sure many christians seem think jews christians one big family well get page jesus comes back may may happen jews christians far less spiritually aligned sunnis shiites doingso yes rep greene might well investigate things gain deeper understanding actual battle lines dr theater source popularity,16,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

A prominent example is Boasian anthropology. Similar developments is argued to have occurred in social science generally (see cultural Marxism). In particular, there have been opposition to race and intelligence research results.Race denialism is the denial of the existence of (politically sensitive aspects of) human races.There are several groups of race denialists: Biological (genetic) races exist, but this only affects areas that are not politically sensitive, such as skin color. Most importantly, race is not connected with any politically sensitive mental characteristic. This was the implicit view of early race denialists (such as early Boasian anthropologists), who found it impossible at this time to completely deny race. A well-known example was the declaration ""The Race Question"". Biological (genetic) races do not exist, but socially constructed races do. This is the view of adherents of critical race theory, which is a variant of critical theory (the Frankfurt School). Despite the rejection of biological races, the social constructs may still be seen as very important for reasons such as being involved in racism. Races do not exist at all.Boasian anthropology is an influential movement in anthropology, originating with the Jewish self-proclaimed anthropologist Franz Boas. The movement has also had various influences outside of anthropology.

 I mean, yeah? That's the purpose of why Lindsey, Peterson, etc refer to radical liberalism as ""cultural marxism,"" why the right does it, why many other libs do. It's why right critiques ""3rd wave feminism,"" why the right complains about ""misuse"" or ""meaningless"" of terms like racism, fascism, etc; you'll notice that in all of these cases, such critique is presented as the only alternative, rather than complete rejection of it. ""Cultural marxism"" thus serves to separate liberalism that the person doesn't like from their own form of it; so does fascism, communism, etc. ""3rd wave feminism"" complaints serve to re-affirm support for feminism; complaints about misuse or meaningless of racism serve to preserve the notion of racism as a heresy. None of these critique are radical nor do they radically challenge any of it, because, once again, it's an intra-liberal conflict, and the people taking issue with these like these agree with underlying premises, values, etc, they merely think rad libs/etc ""go too far"" in attempting to fulfill such ideals.",politics theater intraliberal conflict specifically old school libs generated system resisting change ruling ideology imposition radical liberalism itll fail like resistance old school liberalism failed would become ok question improvements theyd forced upon us past century modern world follow fatal course right end new readjustment intervene case grecolatin decadence reaches bottom abyss drawn would seem halt midway longer possible since according indications furnished traditional doctrines fact entered upon last phase kaliyuga darkest period dark age state dissolution impossible emerge otherwise cataclysm since mere readjustment necessary stage complete renovation disorder confusion prevail every domain carried point far surpassing known previously issuing west threaten invade whole world rene guenon think purpose extract child grooming shit leftoid agenda mean yeah thats purpose lindsey peterson etc refer radical liberalism cultural marxism right many libs right critiques rd wave feminism right complains misuse meaningless terms like racism fascism etc youll notice cases critique presented alternative rather complete rejection cultural marxism thus serves separate liberalism person doesnt like form fascism communism etc rd wave feminism complaints serve reaffirm support feminism complaints misuse meaningless racism serve preserve notion racism heresy none critique radical radically challenge intraliberal conflict people taking issue like agree underlying premises values etc merely think rad libsetc go far attempting fulfill ideals,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

Well, its for the same reason why Han was edited to shoot second.

 Pope Francis‚Äôs criticisms of free-market capitalism don‚Äôt mesh well with available facts, empirical evidence, or a basic understanding of how economics actually works. ""Francis reiterated his belief that ‚Äúif one person lacks what is necessary to live with dignity, it is because another person is detaining it.‚Äù He concluded that ‚Äúthe right to private property can only be considered a secondary natural right, derived from the principle of the universal destination of created goods.‚Äù

But in your existing society private property is already done away with for nine-tenths of the population; its existence for the few is solely due to its non-existence in the hands of those nine-tenths. You reproach us, therefore, with intending to do away with a form of property, the necessary condition for whose existence is the non-existence of any property for the immense majority of society. In one word, you reproach us with intending to do away with your property. Precisely so: that is just what we intend.‚Äù ~ Karl Marx, The Communist Manifesto ""First, the Democrats systematically destroy (politically, socially and economically) the major metropolitan areas in a targeted state; then they fan out across that state enacting the same devastating policies and unconstitutional laws at the local level. In this way, ultra-liberal politicians are planted across the state, by funding from George Soros‚Äô subversive foundations, who then radically liberalize all rules and regulation within the taken-over jurisdictions which advance their cataclysmic cultural marxist agenda."" George Soros found a comrade in the Vatican. ""Pope Francis Praises Soros-Funded Organization; Encourages ‚ÄúResistance‚Äù On 17 February, Pope Francis released a letter written for those gathered for the World Meeting of Popular Movements held in California from 16-19 February ‚Äî a meeting organized by the Vatican. Such meetings regularly take place in the Vatican and are initiated by Pope Francis himself in his attempt to work together with a variety of grassroots movements world-wide. In the letter, which is dated 10 February, Pope Francis publicly praises the organization PICO ‚Äî People Improving Communities through Organizing ‚Äî which was one of the promoters of this Vatican event. Francis writes: I would also like to highlight the work done by the PICO National Network and the organizations promoting this meeting. I learned that PICO stands for ‚ÄúPeople Improving Communities through Organizing‚Äù. What a great synthesis of the mission of popular movements: to work locally, side by side with your neighbors, organizing among yourselves, to make your communities thrive. [my emphasis] What Pope Francis does not mention here is that PICO is heavily funded by George Soros. Leftist watchdog website Discover the Political Networks describes PICO as a group that ‚Äúuses Alinsky-style organizing tactics to advance the doctrines of the religious left.‚Äù As John-Henry Westen, editor-in-chief of LifeSiteNews reported in August of 2016, leaks from the Soros Foundation have shown how Soros funded PICO and other organizations in order to influence the Vatican in favor of certain policies and agendas.""

The socialist strategy is a tool to eradicate the society based on this brutality.‚ÄúPostcolonial,‚Äù ‚Äúdecolonial,‚Äù and ‚Äúcoloniality of power‚Äù ‚Äî these are some of the terms that flooded debates in academia and on the Left in the decades of the neoliberal boom. After the shock of the capitalist crisis of 2008, and with the return of some debates regarding global capitalism and imperialism, criticisms of postcolonial thinking have been reactivated.1 This article addresses some of them, especially Vivek Chibber‚Äôs book Postcolonial Theory and the Specter of Capitalism ‚Äî both its strengths and its limitations.2First, though, we must explore what ‚Äúpostcolonial‚Äù means and why it has become such a ‚Äúunique way of thinking‚Äù among many intellectuals of the so-called ‚ÄúGlobal South.‚Äù Is it a unified theory or a set of heterogeneous critical perspectives? And what should we make of its onslaught against Marxism?Postcolonial, as the word‚Äôs prefix indicates, is a specific variant of the rise of post- in academia. Terry Eagleton once noted that postcolonialism was the foreign relations department of postmodernism.3Postcolonial studies, which has grown in influence since its beginnings in the 1980s and 1990s, has drawn on authors such as Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida as its proponents have intervened on the intellectual terrain. It is a poststructuralist matrix for thinking about the relationship between center and peripheries, as well as between capitalism and racism/colonialism.Genesis of Postcolonial CriticismThe origins of postcolonialism can be traced to the emergence of the Subaltern Studies Group of Indian intellectuals, and the series Subaltern Studies published annually since 1982. Combining a culturalist reading of Antonio Gramsci with notions of Foucaultian and Derridean textualist deconstruction, they set out to intervene in Indian historiography. However, it would be wrong to attribute to this current alone the more pluralistic beginnings of postcolonialism. In those same years, intellectuals of color from the Asian, African, and Caribbean diaspora were engaged in a prolific ideological production in the English-speaking world, especially in literature departments.As an antecedent, Stuart Hall carried out his own Gramscian reading oriented towards post-Marxism, which had several points of contact with Ernesto Laclau‚Äôs work.4 The notions of articulation and hegemony found in Hall‚Äôs work, together with those of hybridity and diaspora, are a precedent for what became the idea of postcolonialism (although Hall remained more anchored in a certain cultural Marxism).Then there are the works of so-called ‚ÄúBlack Marxism‚Äù or Black radicalism, which advanced further with a more general critique of Marxism ‚Äî as in the work of Cedric Robinson, with his definition of ‚Äúracial capitalism‚Äù and call to ‚Äúdecolonize Marxism.‚Äù5 Finally, in Latin America, what is known as decolonization was imposed, especially since the 1990s with the formation of the ‚Äúmodernity/coloniality‚Äù group, composed of several Latin American intellectuals who taught in the United States.6 An√≠bal Quijano‚Äôs concept of coloniality of power is characteristic of this trend, which from the beginning had markedly postmodern features. Some authors emphasize the differences between postcolonial and decolonial, while others present them as nuanced variants of the same logic.Postcolonial or decolonial feminism developed its own concepts and has extended in important ways all the way to the present, with the work of Chicana, Latin American, Indigenous, Asian, and African authors who took aim against what they defined as white, Eurocentric feminism. They include Mar√≠a Lugones, Chandra Talpade Mohanty, and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak.It should be noted that the publication of Edward Said‚Äôs Orientalism in 1978 stands as a fundamental antecedent to all these currents.7 His sharp critiques of Eurocentrism, tracing the construction of the Oriental ‚Äúother‚Äù in the great classics of Western literature and philosophy, was paradigmatic for the new postcolonial thought. Said included Marxism in his critiques of Eurocentrism, something that was also taken up by later currents.More broadly, postcolonial theories converged on certain common conceptions, themes related to the periphery (and peripheries), and reflections on racism and gender in postcolonial societies.8 It constitutes a general critique of ‚ÄúWestern reason‚Äù and a questioning of Marxism for its ‚Äúblindness‚Äù to the colonial or racial question.9 These affinities required a set of theoretical shifts as part of taking the ‚Äúcultural turn‚Äù: the focus on cultural and ideological phenomena, and the abandonment of the centrality of class, in the face of the emergence of the ‚Äúsubaltern‚Äù or new social movements. More generally, it substituted an intellectual practice of deconstructing the ‚ÄúWestern and Eurocentric episteme‚Äù for the anti-imperialist critique (to which I return later).In this article, beyond the more general elements about postcoloniality, the focus is on the production of the Subaltern Studies group. This allows for addressing the shift from Marxist categories toward a postcolonial reading and dealing with some specific criticisms that this current has raised.Gramsci in BengalThe Subaltern Studies group in India was formed around Ranajit Guha, who emigrated to the United Kingdom in 1959.10 Other well-known intellectuals in the group include Dipesh Chakrabarty and Gyan Prakash. Postcolonial feminist philosopher Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak remained very close to them, although without adhering to all their assumptions.Guha was key to the appropriation of Gramsci, reconfiguring the concepts of ‚Äúsubaltern classes‚Äù and ‚Äúhegemony‚Äù for a new reading of Indian history. It was not a reflection on the hegemonic capacity of the working class in alliance with the peasantry ‚Äî something at the very core of Gramscian concern ‚Äî but an analysis of the self-activity of subaltern subjects, especially the peasantry. It was a reflection that could be maintained within the terms of a more classical populism or Maoism, which considers the peasantry to be the basis for ‚Äúpopular‚Äù or ‚Äúnational‚Äù movements of a populist-front type.11 Guha, however, went even further, toward a sort of post-Maoism. His reflection on peasant rebellions led him to formulate the existence of an autonomous peasant consciousness, irreducible to Western categories and to the ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù tendencies of capital. It was then that subaltern studies took a step towards postcolonialism.Guha argued against the idea that the peasants had deployed a ‚Äúpre-political‚Äù or ‚Äúpurely spontaneous‚Äù activity,12 although he recognizes that these rebellions often failed to overcome ‚Äúlocalism, sectarianism, and ethnic divisions.‚Äù The initial objective of subaltern studies was to ‚Äúrehabilitate‚Äù the peasant ‚Äúsubject‚Äù forgotten by liberal and nationalist historiography.13 Guha sets out to read the sources (official documents, colonial reports, etc.) against their grain in order to find evidence of this rebellious consciousness. To do so, ‚Äúwe must take the peasant-rebel‚Äôs awareness of his own world and his will to change it as our point of departure.‚ÄùFor his part, Dipesh Chakrabarty focuses not so much on subaltern subjects, but on ‚Äúsubaltern pasts.‚Äù 14 These subaltern pasts ‚Äúbreak historicization‚Äù because there the spiritual, sacred, ethnic, and caste relations take place, which populate a world that becomes incommensurable from the logic of Western reason. For Chakrabarty:This is another time that, theoretically, could be entirely immeasurable in terms of the godless, spiritless time of what we call ‚Äúhistory,‚Äù an idea already assumed in the secular concepts of ‚Äúcapital‚Äù and ‚Äúabstract labor.‚Äù15So the subaltern, in subaltern studies, is a notion that differs from both nationalist and liberal historiographies, as well as from Marxism.In a related argument, Guha puts forward the idea of the existence of two separate spheres, the subaltern and that of the politics of the nationalist elites ‚Äî something that expresses ‚Äúthe failure of the Indian bourgeoisie to speak for the nation,‚Äù16 or the failure to integrate the subaltern strata into its hegemony. From his point of view, the central problem of the new Indian historiography is the ‚Äústudy of this historical failure of the nation to come to its own ‚Äî a failure that he attributes to both the bourgeoisie and the working class.17 Guha points out that modernity in India showed that capital failed, historically, to realize its universalizing tendency under colonial conditions, which in turn led to its failure to crush native South Asian culture or completely assimilate it. He calls this phenomenon ‚Äúdominance without hegemony,‚Äù a characteristic he finds in both the colonial period and the nationalist experience. Now, what would be the causes of this frustration?Guha tackles the problem in Dominance without Hegemony.18 The book has very interesting chapters, such as the one devoted to British colonial rule in India. There he points out that the construction of the state, promoted from above by British colonialism together with the local elites, relied above all on coercion to maintain/impose forms of forced labor of a quasi-servile type and the crushing of all resistance. The native bourgeoisie was born subordinate to colonialism, and strongly hierarchical pre-capitalist social relations, such as caste and patriarchal relations, were preserved or reconfigured. Guha points to the historical engagement of the native bourgeoisie with the landlords and the ‚Äúcomplicity with many forms of feudal oppression,‚Äù[Ibid., 132.]] as well as the fact that Indian industrialists identified workers‚Äô mobilization (especially after the Russian Revolution) as a threat to their class interests. In the chapter on the nationalist movement, Guha points out that Gandhi set out to discipline the entire initiative of the peasant masses, to regiment and control them. To this end, he encouraged Congress Party militants to act as ‚Äúpeople‚Äôs policemen‚Äù19 and called for demobilization after each cycle of the movement‚Äôs rise.These reflections regarding the historically subordinated role of the native bourgeoisie and the limits of the nationalist movement point to key elements for thinking about the problem. However, once raised, they neither become a continuous thread in the book nor more generally in the elaborations published in Subaltern Studies. Rather, they came to revolve around a different hypothesis: that the historical failure of Indian nationalism originated in the impossibility of the nationalist elites to incorporate subaltern subjectivity into a unified national project, within the frameworks of the rational categories of the West.Chakrabarty, for his part, challenges the idea that ‚Äú[Indian] capitalism or political modernity has remained ‚Äòincomplete‚Äô‚Äù and points out that India‚Äôs ‚Äúhistory of political modernity could not be written as a simple application of the analytics of capital and nationalism available in Western Marxism.‚Äù20 It would be a capitalism without hegemonic bourgeois relations, following Guha‚Äôs formulations. Chakrabarty‚Äôs proposal is to ‚Äúprovincialize‚Äù Europe so that European thought can ‚Äúbe renewed from and for the margins‚Äù21 ‚Äî recovering a thought ‚Äútied to places and to particular forms of life,‚Äù22 necessarily fragmentary.23 This line of reflection on the marginal, the fragmentary. and the locally situated would mark the evolution of subaltern studies, in which textualist tendencies became increasingly strong.One of Spivak‚Äôs first interventions in the debate on subalternity was her well-known text ‚ÄúCan the Subaltern Speak?‚Äù It opens with a polemic with Foucault and Gilles Deleuze. The author challenges both authors for not taking into account the relationship between power-knowledge structures and the constitution of Europe as a colonial power. The central thesis of her essay is that the subalterns are those who cannot ‚Äúspeak‚Äù for themselves and, therefore, their history cannot be written. In her words, ‚Äúthe subaltern is necessarily the absolute limit of the place where history is narrativized into logic.‚Äù24 Here Spivak radicalizes the group‚Äôs initial approach, noting as ‚Äústrategic essentialism‚Äù the claim to recover the consciousness of the subaltern. As a postcolonial feminist, Spivak notes further that subalternity is found more than anything else in the ‚Äúparadigmatic victims‚Äù of the international division of labor, the women of the urban ‚Äúsubproletariat,‚Äù and in informal labor, as well as in those belonging to the unorganized layers of rural labor.As a general trend, the subalternist group was, by the 1990s, acquiring a language and reflections increasingly akin to postmodernism, focusing on the reading of literary sources and other textual resources. But, as already indicated, this was only one of the strands of postcolonial reason. Let us now consider, on a more general level, some of the criticisms that have been made of postcoloniality.Critiques of Postcolonial ReasonPostcolonialists share with other intellectuals the conviction that the emancipatory projects of the 20th century ‚Äî the rebellions, uprisings, workers‚Äô and peasants‚Äô insurrections, and struggles for socialism ‚Äî do not offer a strategic perspective for today. They question the ‚Äúmetanarratives of emancipation,‚Äù among which they include bourgeois nationalism and Marxism (although they do not question capitalist social relations with the same radicalism, even in the heyday of neoliberalism). This is what Aijaz Ahmad called the ‚Äú‚Äòpost-‚Äôcondition.‚Äù25 It is an ‚Äúintellectual style‚Äù marked by the rejection of ‚Äúuniversalist‚Äù ideas such as emancipation, equality, freedom, socialism, and communism, since for postcolonialists, these are synonymous with Eurocentrism, colonialism, and totalitarianism. They also share with poststructuralists their fascination with the fragmentary, the episodic, and the difference, as well as the substitution of an anti-systemic political practice for a deconstructive textual practice.Ahmad points out that the postcolonial dissolves the difference between literature and history, as well as between literature and philosophy, prioritizing rhetorical criticism. He also notes that the postcolonial ‚Äúdissolve[s] all enduring questions of imperialism and anti-imperialism into an infinite play of heterogeneity and contingency.‚Äù The postcolonialists question Marxism for supposedly making use of abstract and totalizing categories that do not account for the particular and contingent. And they define ‚ÄúWestern reason‚Äù in a way that abstracts it from all historical determination.Several authors have criticized postcolonialism for affirming a ‚Äúbackwards essentialism‚Äù in which the spatial location of a thinker or the geographical origin of a current of thought would determine its ‚ÄúEurocentric‚Äù and ‚Äúcolonialist‚Äù condition. It is a geographical and ethnicist determinism that also constructs the false idea of a unique ‚ÄúWestern episteme,‚Äù denying the complex and multiple theoretical, cultural, and social disputes that have taken place within it in different periods.26 On the one hand, these authors reject the ‚ÄúWestern‚Äù categories of Marxism, such as working class, revolution, and socialism, because they do not allow them to account for the ‚Äúincommensurability‚Äù of the colonial and postcolonial world. At the same time, they translate for their own purposes the highlights of French poststructuralism, as part of the idealist heritage of Western philosophy. The identification of secularism with colonialism or Eurocentrism is especially problematic, as if secular thought, science, and rationality had to be flatly rejected simply because they had emanated historically from Western European countries. The rejection en bloc of all the elements of modernity can lead only to variants of conservatism, in the precise sense of the word as that which seeks a return to millenarian or religious ways of thinking.Finally, most postcolonialists counterpose modernity and coloniality with vindication for ‚Äúother ways of being in the world‚Äù such as millenarian peasant communities. But they omit that in many of these pre-capitalist societies, there were also brutal forms of oppression of women, caste hierarchies, inter-ethnic violence, slavery, and other forms of social subjugation.Critique of Postcoloniality: The Universal and the ParticularIn his book Postcolonial Theory and the Specter of Capital, Vivek Chibber takes up several of these critiques of postcoloniality, although he focuses his polemic on the work published in Subaltern Studies. The book provoked intense debate at the time of its publication, and it is worth dwelling a bit more extensively on his arguments.Chibber points out what he considers to be the main theses of subalternist historiography: 1) the idea of a non-hegemonic bourgeoisie; 2) derailing the universalizing impulse of capital in the East; 3) the pluralization of power; 4) the idea of two separate spheres, the elites and the subalterns; 5) the failure of nationalism as a result of adhering to Western reasoning about modernization; and 6) the Eurocentrism of social theories, including Marxism. From this, he questions the emphasis placed on the difference between the West and the East by subalternists. He argues that they romanticize bourgeois revolutions, giving to past European bourgeoisies a ‚Äúuniversalizing‚Äù role that they never really had precisely because the defense of their own class interests would always have been paramount. In this sense, Chibber argues against the idea that the bourgeoisie ever represented anything like the interests of the ‚Äúnation as a whole.‚Äù In doing so, he takes aim at what appears to be an idealization of bourgeois revolutions and liberal democracies by postcolonialists.",subalterns postcolonialists specter capital polemic marxismthe theories ‚äúpostcolonialists‚äù condemn us mere

 Cultural Marxism is not ""anything on the left"", it is the interpretation of all of history as a series of struggles -- the current interpretation is that straight white men are the devil, the oppressor. The only legitimate sorrow in the world is the sorrow of the oppressed according to Marx, and the only way to deal with suffering is revolution. That is exactly what is being taught at a number of universities and is the basis for any statement in the rubrik of ""Strategies for Decentering Whiteness"".

 That makes no sense. Can you seriously read that manifesto and conclude that it. was born of a deep abiding love for humanity?. It is resentful and divisive and obviously so. Please don't play ""well how can you know .."", I know angry and divisive when I see angry and divisive.

We didn‚Äôt pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children‚Äôs children what it was once like in the United States where men were free.‚ÄùRonald Reagan---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------There is an analogy floating around the internet that is very appropriate for the times we are living in. It is the story of a student who asked his professor if he knew how to catch wild pigs. The professor, thinking it a joke, asked for the punch line. The student assured him it was no laughing matter and told the tale:‚ÄúYou catch wild pigs by finding a suitable place in the woods and putting corn on the ground. The pigs find it and begin to come every day to eat the free food. When they are used to coming every day, you put a fence down one side of the place where they are used to coming. When they get used to the fence, they begin to eat the corn again and you put up another side of the fence. They get used to that and start to eat again. You continue until you have all four sides of the fence up with a gate in the last side. The pigs, which are used to the free corn, start to come through the gate to eat that free corn again. You then slam the gate on them and catch the whole herd. Suddenly the wild pigs have lost their freedom. They run around and around inside the fence, but they are caught. Soon they go back to eating the free corn. They are so used to it that they have forgotten how to forage in the woods for themselves, so they accept their captivity.‚Äù In this analogy, the ‚Äúfree corn‚Äù‚Äîin the case of American citizens‚Äîare government subsidies that are doled out to control the masses. Welfare, Food Stamps, Earned Income Credit, free housing, free phones, free internet, health-care, et al, have been dangled in our faces for decades. We have willfully slopped at the government trough. However, we should all know that there is no such thing as a ‚Äúfree‚Äù lunch. Invariably there is a price to be paid. In the case of America today, that price has been exorbitant. Karl Marx, the author of The Communist Manifesto, has been credited by some as saying, ‚ÄúRemove one freedom per generation and soon you will have no freedom and no one would have noticed.‚ÄùOwn Nothing... Control EverythingPhase One of the Plan involved the control of money. The current monetary management and banking system has been in place for over one hundred years. You and I have no concept on how banks operated those many years ago before the central bank‚Äîthe ‚ÄúFederal‚Äù Reserve‚Äîwas created. Through propaganda and the buying of politicians, Wall Street bankers and corporate chieftains were able to coerce the population into accepting a central banking system. Along with the creation of the Federal Reserve system, our nation ratified a Constitutional Amendment which implemented a federal income tax. The gist of the propaganda was laid out as such: Soak the Rich. This mind-control technique has been successful for eons. J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller were the prime movers and shakers of that time and their machinations were imperative in gaining control of monetary policy. Rockefeller once stated, ‚ÄúOwn nothing, but control everything.‚Äù Basically, what he meant was ‚Äúwhat you don‚Äôt own can‚Äôt be taken from you.‚Äù In order to protect his wealth from these looming taxes, Rockefeller created a tax-exempt foundation whereby he was able to ‚Äúgive‚Äù away his money but still maintain control. This concept is extremely popular today among the elite, it‚Äôs just sugar-coated as philanthropy.The CrashIn the minds of many financial ‚Äúexperts,‚Äù the stock market crash of 1929 was a controlled demolition to enrich the elite and gain further control over the peasants of America. Within the throes of chaos emerged Franklin D. Roosevelt (a ""jew"") and his New Deal. His socialist plan would resurrect our nation‚Äôs economy, bringing financial repair to those harmed by massive loss of jobs and money. Phase Two of the Plan occurred during this era. The men of that time were made of iron and not wood. Government handouts were seen as an affront to their manhood. To circumvent this, Roosevelt implemented the Works Program, paying men to work on so-called projects to benefit our nation. The implementation of what we know as welfare had begun. During his reign Roosevelt also implemented the Social Security System because the peasants were too ignorant to manage their own savings and retirement accounts. Originally, the citizens were told that the Social Security number would not be used as an identifier.That policy changed quickly and permanently as your SSN has become the de facto federal identification‚Äîrequired by Internal Revenue Service, the military, banks, colleges, health insurance companies, and many others. With the onset of World War II, Roosevelt established the War Production Board. The coordination between private industry and the wartime production is seen by some as the beginning of the ‚Äúmilitary-industrial complex‚Äù that President Eisenhower spoke of in his farewell address. The ensuing cold war with Russia led to an ever-increasing expansion of the weapons industry.The Ultimate Coup d‚ÄôEtatAllen Dulles photo:Longest serving leader of the CIA, Allen Dulles‚Äô job, simply put, was to hijack the US government to benefit the wealthy.In 1942 the Office of Strategic Services was created by Franklin D. Roosevelt (a ""jew""). This was the forerunner to Central Intelligence Agency. One of its operators was Allen Dulles. Dulles became the first civilian Director of the CIA and holds the distinction of being its longest serving leader. In his outstanding expos√©, Final Judgment, Michael Collins Piper makes a very strong case that Dulles was supremely involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The removal of Kennedy from the throne of power insured that the CIA would not be shut down. With the ascension of Lyndon B. Johnson to the presidency, the CIA was able to expand its involvement in the conflict with Vietnam. The 1960s also experienced a tidal wave of social engineering by way of our universities and colleges. Cultural Marxism, or political correctness, had finally infiltrated these institutions of higher learning and the subsequent graduation and expansion of this ideology now permeates our society.Submission By The PeasantsAfter the false flag action of destroying the Twin Towers in New York City, the elite took a giant leap against mankind. With the implementation of the Patriot Act, the Fourth Amendment was summarily stricken from our Constitution. No longer were Americans secure in their own homes as this new law allowed law enforcement to search a home or business without consent or knowledge under certain circumstances. The FBI was allowed to search telephone, email, and financial records without a court order. The National Security Agency has expanded its facilities to support massive mainframe computers where dossiers of our citizens are stored. Sadly, nary a word of opposition was offered by the masses. Having partaken of the Kool Aid spewed forth from Main Stream Media, the thought of security and safety far outweighed any desire for liberty. American‚Äôs submission to the elite is reaching its endgame.Quarantines and LockdownsThe pLandemic that was unleashed on our nation in the spring of 2020 led to some of the most draconian orders ever issued by elected officials. Never before in our history had the healthy been told to quarantine. Early onset of symptoms were ignored until a health crisis had evolved. Alternative medicines with high efficacy rates were blocked from usage. A diminutive and sinister operator, Anthony Fauci, was placed front and center in this scam. Unbeknownst to the masses, this man had financed‚Äîwith U.S. taxpayer money‚Äîbioweapon research in China. Mask mandates, lockdown orders and quarantines dominated the news cycle. Deaths and case numbers were constantly bombarding the minds of our citizens. Those easily swayed bought this disinformation hook, line, and sinker. If anyone dared to offer a separate opinion the masses would screech, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs on the news, it‚Äôs all over the internet. It has to be the truth. You must be a conspiracy nutjob!‚Äù For those who are diligent in researching and searching for truth, the writing is clearly on the wall. With population reduction one of the stated goals of the elite, this scamdemic is the perfect launch point for achievement. What is known of the mRNA ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù millions have taken? What side affects could be caused? Only time will tell. I can think of no better way to sterilize large numbers of people than to create a pandemic and implement mandatory vaccines. Ronald Reagan was correct in his statement, ‚ÄúFreedom is never more than one generation away from extinction.‚Äù It is time, dear friend, to prepare.‚ÄúWatch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye

 Honestly there was no major racial problem back then. Multiculturalism was fine. They invented and remade Racial tensions to help lubricate the tracks for Cultural Marxism, a LEVER for the Globalists to usurp our culture and heritage by manipulating and using the vulnerable and marginalized. Evil preys upon the weak.. Worming its way up from the bottom using the weak as a BIOFILM to portray a righteousness upright posture to the outside world. This in the same way Bacteria use Calcium to form a Biofilm to trick its host into seeing it as inert. Its Sociopathic. Its pure degeneracy and its ancient survival traits that should be weeded out with great enthusiasm and cast and bred out of our species with much prejudice wherever leadership and responsibility is involved. This narcissism. This malignancy trait of the ego that is killing our once great society, it must be routed or we will surely perish. Its why Good Men refuse to try and lead. 
 
 
 
  We must learn the words and tools of our enemies and engage them in whatever theater or forum. We must give them no ground. This most importantly includes culture. We must be everywhere. We must see everything. Each Pepe must become a Super Pepe that is all seeing and all knowing. There is no place the battle does not rage. It could be crypto currency, stocks, the local PTA, the municipal library, children's cartoons, the schoolyard, and anywhere and everywhere. Good and Evil are always at odds and Evil is always trying to CLOAK itself. So take control. Start at your Dinner table and work your way out in concentric rings. Identify who pushes or is inflicted by the malignant wokism, and identify them as a threat to you and the people you love. Confront where you must. But generally, do it slowly and cast them out of your sphere of influence, innocuously so as to not arouse suspicions. And why? Because evasion is better and less costly then direct confrontations. Thus reserve all energy and resources for any battles where it truly is unavoidable and matters most. Cancel culture can be dangerous. What we do is create a parallel community that seeks to push these monsters away like a stiff breeze rather then a raging storm. Like we do on websites such as this one. We do this to set an example and tone that can become, culturally speaking, an adaptable, adoptable, digestible example for others 'meaker' then ourselves. We show them how to resist calmly, quietly, and peacefully by removing our interests from being entangled with the enemy. And we do this in a way that makes the enemy's own behaviors make them stand out ever more, just as we are seeing happen now in many areas. Always trying to show their dedication to the cult, they grow ever more absurd, bombastic, and verbose in their virtue signalling displays and parading. 
 
  
 
 We may become like Aldous Huxley's Savages, but at least we will be free, and have many non-vaccinated friends to keep us all company.

 It‚Äôll start with Harry Potter and the Questions He is Just Asking. That‚Äôll turn some heads, but he hasn‚Äôt gone full on Nazi here, they‚Äôre just goblins, after all! No jews here, Rowling‚Äôs defenders will say.
 
 Then we‚Äôll have Harry Potter and the Great Replacement. This blatant reference to the white supremacist myth (of whites becoming a minority through cultural Marxism or some other horseshit) will definitely lift an eyebrow or two. But Rowling will feign ignorance, and her fans, growing ever thinner in numbers, will still defend her. ‚ÄúNo!‚ÄùThey‚Äôll say, ‚Äúit‚Äôs about how goblins are slowly replacing humans in the wizarding world, there‚Äôs not a single mention of Jews!‚Äù Some will, of course, find it weird, that when Harry begins giving rousing speeches at beer halls, some join in on chants of ‚ÄúHeil Harry‚Äù but it will become nothing more than a controversial bestseller.
 
 Harry Potter and the Goblin Question comes next, and Rowling‚Äôs editor will note that the author sometimes forgets to write ‚Äúgoblin‚Äù in certain parts of the book, instead using ‚Äúsemite‚Äù and near the end of the novel literally writes ‚Äújew‚Äù. But the editor will just control+F jew and replace it all with goblin (just a small mistake, he thinks), and Rowling has another bestseller. Some feathers will be ruffled, undoubtedly, especially when Fuhrer Potter starts suggesting an ‚Äúultimate solution‚Äù, but benefit of the doubt will be given. After all, Rowling says, ‚ÄúI am not an anti-Semite. I have plenty of Jewish friends, they produce and finance the movie versions of my films! No one who hates Jews would spend the amount of time in Hollywood or at the bank that I have spent!‚Äù
 
 For a time, benefit of the doubt will be given, but Rowling will start to become a little more brazen as time goes on. Fans eagerly await the next installment in the Harry Potter series, all the while Rowlings Twitter becomes increasingly unhinged. She starts taking great offense to everyone sounding the alarms about the thinly veiled antisemitic references in her new books, and begins railing against cultural Marxism, strangely enough. She does a bit of a right wing media tour, appearing and Dave Rubin, having a little chat with Jordan Peterson, and attempts to appeal to the center with Joe Rogan (with whom she vehemently comes out as anti-vaccine, and smokes a blunt).

Lukacs was one of the key people behind the creation of the Frankfurt School.

Cultural Marxism,2022-03-24,14:08:21,racmusic,Minds,,"Who ‚Äî or What ‚Äî Are the Jews? by James Harting Adolf Hitler wrote, ‚ÄúThe mightiest counterpart to the Aryan is represented by the Jew.‚Äù But what, exactly, do we mean when we say the word ‚ÄúJews?‚Äù The question has been sincerely asked: ‚ÄúWhat is the problem, Jews, or the Jewish cult? Are Jews simply people with a horrible religion that makes the things they do justified in their minds?‚Äù The root problem of the Jews is the Jews themselves, not whatever theology they espouse at any given point in history. The Jews are defined by their racial soul, which in turn helps form their racial personality. This racial soul is encoded in the Semitic DNA of the Jews and cannot be washed away by baptism or other incredible practices. A pure-blooded Jew has a 100% Jewish racial soul; a half-breed (mischling in German and Yiddish) has 50%, a quarter Jew 25% and so on. In terming the Jews a biological race or ethnicity, it needs to be noted that the Jews of the world are subdivided in several distinct sub-ethnicities. This is because although the Jews have an unmistakable core of Semitic blood, they have become a mongrel folk, who have liberally assimilated the genes of the host populations in the numerous countries in which they have historically resided. The two main Jewish sub-ethnicities are the Sephardim, sometimes called ‚ÄúMediterranean Jews,‚Äù and the Ashkenazim, or ‚ÄúEuropean Jews.‚Äù Additionally, there are various minor Jewish ethnicities, including (but not limited to) the Mizrahim (so-called ‚ÄúEastern‚Äù or ‚ÄúOriental‚Äù Jews), the Romaniote Jews of Greece and the ‚ÄúMountain Jews‚Äù of Azerbaijan and neighboring areas. Because of the mixture of the original Semitic bloodline with the blood of non-Jews, terming someone a ‚Äúfull-blooded‚Äù Jew is only relative. Nonetheless, the Semitic core of the Jews defines who they are racially. Here is how the Jewish racial personality expresses itself in the modern world: Judaism, which has changed over the centuries, is the religious expression of the Jewish racial personality. Zionism is the inward political expression of that personality. By ‚Äúinward,‚Äù I mean that it is meant for the Jews alone. Bolshevism (Marxism, communism, etc.) is the outward political expression of the Jewish racial personality. By ‚Äúoutward‚Äù I mean that it is directed towards non-Jews (goyim in Hebrew and Yiddish). Cultural Marxism is expression of the Jewish racial personality in the cultural and social spheres. In art (music, painting architecture, sculpture and literature), the Jew upholds the cult of ugliness, and champions chaos and disorder; he pits men and women against one another, and the young against the old; he encourages every form of sexual perversion and degeneracy, and wages war against the nuclear family. Capitalism is the economic expression of the Jewish racial personality. Hebrew is the primary linguistic expression of the Jewish racial personality, although there are secondary Jewish languages, including Yiddish, Ladino, Bukharan, Judeo-Tat, Yevanic and many others. To repeat myself, then, the fundamental problem with the Jews is the Jews themselves, and not the secondary expressions of their racial personality, be it Judaism, Zionism, Bolshevism, Capitalism or whatever.",‚äî ‚äî jews james harting adolf hitler wrote ‚äúthe mightiest counterpart aryan represented jew‚äù exactly mean say word ‚äújews‚äù question sincerely asked ‚äúwhat problem jews jewish cult jews simply people horrible religion makes things justified minds‚äù root problem jews jews whatever theology espouse given point history jews defined racial soul turn helps form racial personality racial soul encoded semitic dna jews washed away baptism incredible practices pureblooded jew jewish racial soul halfbreed mischling german yiddish quarter jew terming jews biological race ethnicity needs noted jews world subdivided several distinct subethnicities although jews unmistakable core semitic blood become mongrel folk liberally assimilated genes host populations numerous countries historically resided two main jewish subethnicities sephardim sometimes called ‚äúmediterranean jews‚äù ashkenazim ‚äúeuropean jews‚äù additionally various minor jewish ethnicities including limited mizrahim socalled ‚äúeastern‚äù ‚äúoriental‚äù jews romaniote jews greece ‚äúmountain jews‚äù azerbaijan neighboring areas mixture original semitic bloodline blood nonjews terming someone ‚äúfullblooded‚äù jew relative nonetheless semitic core jews defines racially jewish racial personality expresses modern world judaism changed centuries religious expression jewish racial personality zionism inward political expression personality ‚äúinward‚äù mean meant jews alone bolshevism marxism communism etc outward political expression jewish racial personality ‚äúoutward‚äù mean directed towards nonjews goyim hebrew yiddish cultural marxism expression jewish racial personality cultural social spheres art music painting architecture sculpture literature jew upholds cult ugliness champions chaos disorder pits men women one another young old encourages every form sexual perversion degeneracy wages war nuclear family capitalism economic expression jewish racial personality hebrew primary linguistic expression jewish racial personality although secondary jewish languages including yiddish ladino bukharan judeotat yevanic many others repeat fundamental problem jews jews secondary expressions racial personality judaism zionism bolshevism capitalism whatever,73,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1

The problem is, however, that cultural marxism is far more insidious and cancerous than even regular old fashioned marxism, because it can NEVER stop.The second you start treating people differently based on their identity characteristics, you open the door for everyone else to bitch and complain and moan about needing special treatment as well. And the fact that they gave it to one, means they have to give it to others else their power is not legitimate.So what happens?First you might start with groups based on gender or race. It might just be men and women being divided, and then white/black/asian/latino etc.,Next, you have to represent the people of different nationalities and sexual orientations, and gender ""identities"". So it goes from black people being represented, to now needing to represent black females.But wait, there's more! What happens when black females get represented? Well, of course, the black female muslim transgender disabled lesbians need to be represented.What happens when they get represented though? The same thing of all races must be represented. Then it starts going down further rabbit holes, like hair color, height, personality type, people who prefer cats to dogs, people who don't like hotsauce, cancer survivors, people with teeth or people who have no teeth.That's the direction you start going down, which means you will not stop until you hit the ultimate minority - the individual. At some point, the only way you can be inclusive and represent everyone on the SCOTUS is to literally let everybody on the planet be a member.We can see, obviously, how insane and retarded this shit is. It leads nowhere good.Which is precisely why identity should NEVER be allowed to be a factor in determining peoples opportunities. We should NEVER even try to ""represent"" people like that.The job should solely be based on whether you are the best candidate.

Cultural Marxism,2022-03-13,0:43:54,FDHnews,Minds,,"JEW CONTROL: compiled by Jon Miller It‚Äôs not an anti-Semitic conspiracy when you‚Äôve got 2% of the population making up almost 100% of the current administration‚Äôs cabinet. That‚Äôs mere mathematics. And the obvious conclusion from that is Jews have an outsized influence on our government. This is true for Biden. It was true for Trump as well, whose closest advisers ‚ÄìKushner, Michael Cohen, Gary Cohn, Stephen Miller, even his own daughter ‚Äì were all Jewish. Both political parties are duty bound to Jews because Jews are by far the biggest donors to both Republicans and Democrats. Again, just a matter of the numbers. The institutions that shape public opinion are also ostensibly run by Jews. Every major newspaper and television network is either owned, managed, or financed by Jews, as are our other sources for news and information. Zuckerberg, Sergei Brin, Larry Page, and Susan Wojcicki control effectively the entire web through Facebook and Google, which essentially act as a gate to all of our information. So again, not ‚Äúhate speech‚Äù to say that the internet is controlled by Jews (the people who control the internet are Jewish.) On Wall Street, one of only two remaining huge investment banks, Goldman Sachs, is unapologetically Jewish, proudly founded by Jews and almost all of its partners since then have been Jewish, as well as its current CEO David Solomon. Everyone knows the federal reserve has seen its fair share of Jewish chairmen from Alan Greenspan to Stanley Fischer (who also led the IMF ), to Ben Bernanke, Jeremy Stein, and Janet Yellen (who has recently shuffled through the revolving door over to Treasury to replace Steve Mnuchin, also Jewish, who replaced Jack Lew, another Jew and Zionist, who replaced Tim Geithner, also a Zionist Jew. ) The Ex-Im bank is headed up by Jewish banker Fred Hochberg (also a homosexual.) The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair is Gary Gensler, which if you couldn‚Äôt guess is or Jewish descent. The president of the World Bank Group David Malpass is Jewish as was his predecessor James Wolfensohn. The most influential (and simultaneously radical) well funded international organizations are headed by Jews, and if their mission was not to overtly foment revolutions around the world and grasp control of international levers of power, they wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about negative stereotypes. But Jewish chairman of the World Economic Forum (WEF) Klaus Schwab openly uses the organization to conspire with the rich and powerful to destroy the West through a corporate takeover of all governments known as the Great Reset. The Jewish president of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) Richard Haass, who had a key role during the Bush years in coming up with the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan, works with others on the CFR to subvert our sovereignty and submerge the world into some one-word government. Haass‚Äô council is made up of a dizzying number of powerful Jews like Henry Kissinger, Michael Bloomberg, Jake Tapper, Anthony Blinken (Secretary of State and also a dual citizen of Israel),Sheryl Sandberg, ADL‚Äôs Jonathan Greenblatt, Madeleine Albright, JP Morgan‚Äôs Jamie Dimon (not Jewish but married to one), Obamacare architect Zeke Emmanuel, David Geffen of Universal Music Group, Max Boot of WashPost, David Stern owner of NBA, Paul Krugman of NYT, Frank Luntz, Andrea Mitchell NBC, former treasury secretary Robert Rubin, the list goes on‚Ä¶ Then you‚Äôve got the eerily ubiquitous puppet master billionaire financier and subversive radical Jew George Soros has essentially created his own ‚Äúshadow government‚Äù that manipulates regimes and currencies for its own enrichment. His Open Society Foundation exists to tear down governments and spark revolutions around the world when they don‚Äôt serve his interests. Through Open Society, the Velvet Revolution in the Czech Republic was possible, as was the Orange Revolution in the Ukraine, the Rose Revolution in Georgia‚Ä¶. All funded at least in part by Soros. He helped engineer coups in Slovakia, Croatia, and Yugoslavia, and has worked to destabilize our already broken border and now is moving onto the current war in the Ukraine. In the past, Jews led similar movements as leaders of the Bolshevik revolution; its most prominent revolutionaries including Trotsky and Lenin were Jewish. They laid the groundwork that successfully led to the destruction of Russia as the we knew it through famine and genocide in the Soviet Ukraine. Nearly all of the primary far-Left subversive Marxist thought leaders were Jewish, including Marx himself obviously. The academics of the Frankfurt School, responsible for the blueprint on destroying western culture through cultural Marxism, were all Jewish. Every single one of them. In the 1920s they came up with a plan to destroy Western culture by replacing traditional American history with godlessness, degeneracy and homosexuality in the classroom which is only now in full effect. The Jewish influence on our foreign policy is undeniably borne out by the wildly disproportionate amount of our aid that goes to Israel. With $150 billion in bilateral assistance and defense spending to date, it‚Äôs a numerical fact that Jewish people benefit from our aid more than any other people on the planet. And unless you‚Äôre putting your fingers in your ears and forcing yourself to avoid the question of why we would give so much money to a state that gives us nothing in return, this number stands out like a sore thumb. All of this is decried as ‚Äúanti-Semitism‚Äù because you‚Äôre not supposed to notice. Why? Well the only reason people want to hide things is because they‚Äôre doing behavior they know they shouldn‚Äôt be. It should be a journalist‚Äôs natural instinct to want to peel away the onion here but the stronger instinct to keep their jobs forbids it. Still sunlight is still the best disinfectant, and a sober summary of these facts should be welcome by anyone who is concerned with the truth.",jew control compiled jon miller it‚äôs antisemitic conspiracy you‚äôve got population making almost current administration‚äôs cabinet that‚äôs mere mathematics obvious conclusion jews outsized influence government true biden true trump well whose closest advisers ‚äìkushner michael cohen gary cohn stephen miller even daughter ‚äì jewish political parties duty bound jews jews far biggest donors republicans democrats matter numbers institutions shape public opinion also ostensibly run jews every major newspaper television network either owned managed financed jews sources news information zuckerberg sergei brin larry page susan wojcicki control effectively entire web facebook google essentially act gate information ‚äúhate speech‚äù say internet controlled jews people control internet jewish wall street one two remaining huge investment banks goldman sachs unapologetically jewish proudly founded jews almost partners since jewish well current ceo david solomon everyone knows federal reserve seen fair share jewish chairmen alan greenspan stanley fischer also led imf ben bernanke jeremy stein janet yellen recently shuffled revolving door treasury replace steve mnuchin also jewish replaced jack lew another jew zionist replaced tim geithner also zionist jew exim bank headed jewish banker fred hochberg also homosexual securities exchange commission sec chair gary gensler couldn‚äôt guess jewish descent president world bank group david malpass jewish predecessor james wolfensohn influential simultaneously radical well funded international organizations headed jews mission overtly foment revolutions around world grasp control international levers power wouldn‚äôt worry negative stereotypes jewish chairman world economic forum wef klaus schwab openly uses organization conspire rich powerful destroy west corporate takeover governments known great reset jewish president council foreign relations cfr richard haass key role bush years coming occupation iraq afghanistan works others cfr subvert sovereignty submerge world oneword government haass‚äô council made dizzying number powerful jews like henry kissinger michael bloomberg jake tapper anthony blinken secretary state also dual citizen israelsheryl sandberg adl‚äôs jonathan greenblatt madeleine albright jp morgan‚äôs jamie dimon jewish married one obamacare architect zeke emmanuel david geffen universal music group max boot washpost david stern owner nba paul krugman nyt frank luntz andrea mitchell nbc former treasury secretary robert rubin list goes on‚ä¶ you‚äôve got eerily ubiquitous puppet master billionaire financier subversive radical jew george soros essentially created ‚äúshadow government‚äù manipulates regimes currencies enrichment open society foundation exists tear governments spark revolutions around world don‚äôt serve interests open society velvet revolution czech republic possible orange revolution ukraine rose revolution georgia‚ä¶ funded least part soros helped engineer coups slovakia croatia yugoslavia worked destabilize already broken border moving onto current war ukraine past jews led similar movements leaders bolshevik revolution prominent revolutionaries including trotsky lenin jewish laid groundwork successfully led destruction russia knew famine genocide soviet ukraine nearly primary farleft subversive marxist thought leaders jewish including marx obviously academics frankfurt school responsible blueprint destroying western culture cultural marxism jewish every single one came plan destroy western culture replacing traditional american history godlessness degeneracy homosexuality classroom full effect jewish influence foreign policy undeniably borne wildly disproportionate amount aid goes israel billion bilateral assistance defense spending date it‚äôs numerical fact jewish people benefit aid people planet unless you‚äôre putting fingers ears forcing avoid question would give much money state gives us nothing return number stands like sore thumb decried ‚äúantisemitism‚äù you‚äôre supposed notice well reason people want hide things they‚äôre behavior know shouldn‚äôt journalist‚äôs natural instinct want peel away onion stronger instinct keep jobs forbids still sunlight still best disinfectant sober summary facts welcome anyone concerned truth,58,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1

You are bringing a knife to a gunfight! The Rod of Iron is the Completed Testament Word of God, not the New Testament, to deal with Satan today.
 
 The New Testament doesn't have the ability; the depth & breadth to deal ideologically with Globalism; secular humanism & cultural Marxism. Only the Divine Principle clearly explains God's Ideal of Creation, The Fall, The Mission of the Messiah & God's Providence of Restoration/Salvation.
 
 There's no use ranting & shouting about the NWO without providing the solution. Alex does plenty of that & he too doesn't have a clue how to fix the problem. He can expose it & that's where it ends.
 
 In Rev 20 after Satan was unbound & able to attack again so that the people 'marvelled' at what Satan is doing now, having 'resurrected' 'Communism'. Mortally wounded by Father to now re-emerge as 'Globalism' because we the people didn't give the enemy the 'double tap' to the head, he got off his death bed like Lazarus.
 
 Then in Rev 20:7-10 it is explained that in this time period - now, ""Fire comes down from heaven"" & defeats Satan.
 
 'Fire' is God's word as explained in the Principle & Jer 23:29. That word is the new truth Father brought - Godism, 'The Eight Great Sacred Texts', which Father bequeathed to Sean's couple, not the Bible, not the Bible, not the Bible!
 
 Do you understand? It is only through the 'new truth' that God's Ideal can be fulfilled. Otherwise what was Father's life all about.
 
 It's the word you must keep & practise not following somebody. That is just a bad habit you kept from church life, & leaders wanting to control you like the AA.
 
 As much as Xians bought into the lie of the Rapture, Moonies did the same with the 'law' of following leaders, yet Father said:
 
 ‚ÄúFather is now saying, don't follow any leader or any leader's family. Do you understand? You have to repent.

Feminism, CRT, cultural Marxism: all the same shit - traditional way is bad bad so bad. A whole new language has arisen to support this. Words like Racist, Misogynist, Homophobe and the like have arisen to demonize ideas which predate the wheel. Ideas likepeople prefer the company of their own kindmen and women are differentgay people can undermine social cohesionwere understood for 100,000 years and practiced by every society until critical theory.So when you investigate that, you see that the modern left is in fact Semitic in origin, both philosophically (uniting the ideas of Freud and Marx is the essence of critical theory) and practically: Weil and Horkheimer, and later Alinsky, Steinem, Friedan, Julius Rosenwald, Soros etc. The leaders of the left have always been Jews. Politically, the loudest cheerleaders for the left are often Jews: Sanders, Schumer and in the past, Mr. Immigration himself, Jacob Javits. One need only look at the impeachment(s) of POTUS Trump to see how Jews feel about MAGA. In addition to Schumer, the leaders included Schiff, Nadler and Raskin....and of course Vindman. FYI Raskin's wife is a far left activist (Surprise!) that Sen Manchin is keeping away from the Fed.We see then that:the left is based on critical theory, which is revealed by its name: a critique of traditional social structures. (The Frankfurt school was a social theory school)The creators of this. philosophy and its leaders thereafter are mostly jews, certainly Jews are disproprotionally represented. This tracks with data showing Jews vote 8/10 (D).The only uncertainty is Rep Greene's opinions, which we can't be sure of. But many Christians seem to think Jews and Christians are all one big family and we'll all get on the same page when Jesus comes back. While this may or may not happen, Jews and Christians are far less spiritually aligned than Sunnis and Shiites, and how are they doing?So yes, Rep Greene might do well to investigate these things further and gain a deeper understanding of the actual battle lines, not the D-R theater which is the source of her popularity.",cant speak commenter seems pretty clear modern left based nothing implementing teachings critical theory imported us max horkheimer feminism crt cultural marxism shit traditional way bad bad bad whole new language arisen support words like racist misogynist homophobe like arisen demonize ideas predate wheel ideas likepeople prefer company kindmen women differentgay people undermine social cohesionwere understood years practiced every society critical theoryso investigate see modern left fact semitic origin philosophically uniting ideas freud marx essence critical theory practically weil horkheimer later alinsky steinem friedan julius rosenwald soros etc leaders left always jews politically loudest cheerleaders left often jews sanders schumer past mr immigration jacob javits one need look impeachments potus trump see jews feel maga addition schumer leaders included schiff nadler raskinand course vindman fyi raskins wife far left activist surprise sen manchin keeping away fedwe see thatthe left based critical theory revealed name critique traditional social structures frankfurt school social theory schoolthe creators philosophy leaders thereafter mostly jews certainly jews disproprotionally represented tracks data showing jews vote dthe uncertainty rep greenes opinions cant sure many christians seem think jews christians one big family well get page jesus comes back may may happen jews christians far less spiritually aligned sunnis shiites doingso yes rep greene might well investigate things gain deeper understanding actual battle lines dr theater source popularity,16,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

Cultural Marxism,2022-01-24,6:27:37,sarthakyeet,Reddit,https://reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/sb9hal/honest_questions_for_jp_fans/htzmbdi/,"Hey, I find your initiative to be quite impressive, but I think there's an inherent flaw in the way you're approaching this whole thing. You're (wrongly, I would argue) assuming a common axiom that JP 'fans' subscribe to. 
 
 For instance, if you were talking to a Ben Shapiro audience, you'd know that they have one foundational belief: conservatism (preservation of tradition). That will be common across every Ben Shaprio fan, but their views might differ thereafter. Same thing with other political speakers.
 
 Peterson isn't a political speaker that way. He speaks out against what he dubs 'Cultural marxism' and 'Postmodernism', but his political stance is not set in stone. I remember he was a classic liberal around 2017 (when I started watching him), but now he says he'd count himself as a conservative. He opposed the two things I mentioned above both when he was a liberal and a conservative. This is a small reflection of his audience too.
 
 There's no doubt you'll find more conservatives in Peterson's audience because
 
 1. He speaks out against excess of the Left. (note: He has spoken profusely against the excesses of the Right - in his lectures and books - but that's nothing unique so is largely ignored)
 2. He talks about responsibility, which is a psychological conservation trait
 
 But his audience has other political orientations in a great number. This is because he's not *fundamentally* a political speaker. He tries to repackage ideas from religion, psychoanalysis, personality psychology, philosophy and mythology. This is quite diverse stuff: I don't think you can find a *typical* Peterson listener then. Because of how different they are. 
 
 Lastly, Peterson is appropriated by his listeners for different causes too. Christians try to portray him as a secular-evangelical or something, Red-Pillers as some intellectual-mentor, productivity peeps as a discipliner/motivator. So it's quite difficult to understand him without either holding up one of these lenses. Or interacting with his content firsthand. This is crucial to understanding when you interact with a Peterson listener because they have no strong common foundation with their fellow listner.
 
 Keeping that in mind, I've been an avid listener of his for a long time, and I'd love to have discussions about stuff if you'd want. I can sympathize with your want to find a community to have such discussions - I feel the same way too, so let me know!",hey find initiative quite impressive think theres inherent flaw way youre approaching whole thing youre wrongly would argue assuming common axiom jp fans subscribe instance talking ben shapiro audience youd know one foundational belief conservatism preservation tradition common across every ben shaprio fan views might differ thereafter thing political speakers peterson isnt political speaker way speaks dubs cultural marxism postmodernism political stance set stone remember classic liberal around started watching says hed count conservative opposed two things mentioned liberal conservative small reflection audience theres doubt youll find conservatives petersons audience speaks excess left note spoken profusely excesses right lectures books thats nothing unique largely ignored talks responsibility psychological conservation trait audience political orientations great number hes fundamentally political speaker tries repackage ideas religion psychoanalysis personality psychology philosophy mythology quite diverse stuff dont think find typical peterson listener different lastly peterson appropriated listeners different causes christians try portray secularevangelical something redpillers intellectualmentor productivity peeps disciplinermotivator quite difficult understand without either holding one lenses interacting content firsthand crucial understanding interact peterson listener strong common foundation fellow listner keeping mind ive avid listener long time id love discussions stuff youd want sympathize want find community discussions feel way let know,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Yeah. that seems to be the case. Although, the longer you watch time go by the more you notice the negative changes. Like the state of the internet right now or how so many movies have had a definite drop in storytelling quality. Click to expand... Perhaps. But also, people lack cultural memory. They act like their generation is Adam and Eve, and that the world didn't exist before then. They disregard the hubris of the past.
 And that Adam-and-Eve complex is getting worse with each new generation of aging adults. Ughubughughughughughghlug said: Very young Millennial, so I guess culturally a Zoomer. Generations are for people who are insecure in their identity but think they‚Äôre too good for nationalism. Click to expand... Alot of post boomer nationalism uses generations as part of ethnic identity.
 In the alt right, there's more age discrimination than racism. Omnium Ultimatus said: I was born in 1999 and my 20th birthday's coming up in a few days. Despite being a zoomer, I barely share anything in common with other zooners, due to my family moving countries halfway through my childhood. However I don't share anything in common with zoomers here either, since I've no interest in befriending them. I abhor western zoomers' cultural Marxism, social media habits, most of everything they consider ""quality content"" and their attitudes towards life. I tend to be far more fatalistic, and prefer to keep to myself most of the time. In those regards, I'm more of a millennial, but in others, I doubt I fit in any generation. Click to expand... Cultural Marxism was a thing that brainwashed millennials too. In fact, Zoomer cringe is just carried over millennials. 5t3n0g0ph3r said: People say I'm in the Millenial Generation.
 I detest it.
 Personally, I separate the Millenial Generation as the ones who were born in the year 2000 or after.
 I know it's wrong but I don't like being lumped into the same category as a generation of spoiled tards who give smart phones to their children who are five years old (a pet peeve of mine). The first time I heard that term outside describing a Roman military unit was two years ago.
 I thought it was dumb. I prefer using ""colleague,"" if anything. Click to expand... Idk why people think kids with smartphones are bad yet think nothing about television.

The corrupt political parties have fell victim to the Marxist tactic of infiltration and subversion. They use our belief in traditional ‚Äúgood‚Äù to insert themselves.

He's gotten worse lately about staying on topic, for instance, at the 23:12 minute mark in his latest video, John Boyd: Maverick, Hero, or Fraud?, he goes on yet another pointless tangent, this time to rant about how ""cultural Marxism [is a] conspiracy theory that proclaims German Jews are secretly working to undermine the ethics of American churches and schools"" in a transparent attempt to smear Boyd with a white nationalist association (it's the second point he tries to make the association, with the intro of the video being a longwinded story about this SS-LARPer he knew in Second Life reminding him of Boyd.) 
 Click to expand... I knew he was a lolcow when I saw a bit of his video about the 'best' tank in WW2.

 The Sabbatean and Frankist groups seemed to disappear by the start of the 19th century. However, there was still an active Frankist stronghold in Frankfurt, Germany during that time. These Frankists were known to be affiliated with the Freemasonic lodges around the city. One such Freemason was a man by the name of **Franz Joseph Molitor.** He took a strong interest in the Kabbalah, even going so far as to attempt to ‚Äúsynthesize‚Äù it with a perversion of Christianity. This interest led him to adopting Sabbatean-Frankist ideology. To promote his views, he wrote a four volume set of books promoting the kabbalistic understanding of judaism, written from the perspective of kabbalists and Sabbateans. **Molitor‚Äôs books were read in the early 20th century by two young jewish scholars from Berlin**: ‚ú°Gershom Scholem‚ú° and his best friend ‚ú°Walter Benjamin.‚ú° Benjamin became a marxist after living in the USSR and meeting with ‚ú°Georg Lukacs‚ú°, **joined the Frankfurt School**, and became one of the main intellectuals behind ‚Äúcritical theory‚Äù alongside ‚ú°Max Horkheimer‚ú° and ‚ú°Theodor Adorno.‚ú° Not just the idea of cultural marxism is jewish, but the whole of communism itself. ‚ú°Karl Marx‚ú°‚Äìfamous for The Communist Manifesto and Das Kaptial‚Äìwas raised in a jewish household and the precepts of communism stem directly from the jewish books of religion. The modern cultural conceptions of relativism, subjectivism, and the ‚Äúimpermanence‚Äù of truth come from communism.

Tearing down statues, censoring speech and literature, removing ""Dead white men"" from the school curriculum, breaking down first gender roles the gender identity, flooding the cities with immigrants and sending third world refugees to the whitest areas, everything the Jews support is aimed at breaking up the ethnic and social cohesion of every country in the Western world.

The second method was to maintain an unwaveringly favourable view of minority groups at all times; any negative behaviour traits associated with a particular minority group was to be solely blamed on the supposed oppression that they had suffered at the hands of the majority.

I find it unconscionable that we are sending billions of dollars to foreign nations, but our troops are being told to sign up for assistance to afford food.But this is just a small example of what is happening for our military. The perilous infusion of cultural Marxism into our Armed Forces is far more dangerous.Recently, the Department of Defense Chief of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Kelisa Wing, who self describes herself as a ""woke administrator,"" made some very disconcerting comments towards white Americans...or folx as she asserts. I have to ask, how much is this racist person being paid while our soldiers are being told to apply for food stamps? But even more troubling is that such a radical individual is allowed access to our military? How can we have an effective, cohesive fighting force when you have a radical Marxist disparaging one demographic of our military force? Cultural Marxism has no place in our Armed Forces and the last thing we need is an office of diversity, equity, and inclusion in our Department of Defense, a cover for enabling these radicals.It was not too long ago that our military was being focused on combat readiness, capability, and capacity to fulfill its mission. Now, we have a Secretary of Defense, with whom I served at Ft. Bragg NC, who is issuing memorandums telling members of our military to get used to troops suffering from gender dysphoria entering shower and latrine facilities with them. Basically, female troops are being told that biological men will be naked, showering with them. Now, if you are an adult and want to play make believe, fine, go ahead, but this should not be happening in our military. As well, the American taxpayer should not be responsible for subsidizing hormonal therapies or surgical procedures for individuals affected by this mental condition...the previous diagnosis of the American Psychiatric Association.Just this past week, the United States Air Force Academy announced new rules about promoting gender neutral language. Can you imagine that the USAFA now advises against saying such simple things as Mom and Dad? They are advising cadets to inquire about a person's desired pronouns before making any declarations. A few months ago, the U.S. Navy issued a video about correct pronoun usage. Hmm, I can remember some very interesting names that Drill Sergeants would use, and they did not inquire about pronouns. Matter of fact, knucklehead is gender neutral, along with stuck on stupid. There seems to be a lot of that in our military and its senior leadership at this time.But what has to be most worrisome for our military has been the illegal, immoral, unethical, and unconstitutional COVID shot mandate forced upon our servicemen and women. Earlier this month, seven cadets at the US Coast Guard Academy were expelled for refusing to take the jab; the same has occurred at the United States Military Academy, West Point. And we are all aware of the countless stories of men and women in uniform who are being persecuted for not taking this shot. There are troops who are being segregated into deplorable living conditions, treated like lepers. They are having their constitutional rights denied, such as religious exemptions. They share their stories with us at the American Constitutional Rights Union's Committee to Support and Defend, America's constitutional conservative Veterans organization.",httpstownhallcomcolumnistsallenwesttheperilsofamericaswokemilitarynutmsourcethdailyutmmediumemailutmcampaignnlbciddbbeafccffabaecddbrecipthe perils americas woke militarylast week shared disturbing news sergeant major army recommended soldiers apply supplemental nutrition assistance program snap aka food stamps keep growing inflation find unconscionable sending billions dollars foreign nations troops told sign assistance afford foodbut small example happening military perilous infusion cultural marxism armed forces far dangerousrecently department defense chief diversity equity inclusion kelisa wing self describes woke administrator made disconcerting comments towards white americansor folx asserts ask much racist person paid soldiers told apply food stamps even troubling radical individual allowed access military effective cohesive fighting force radical marxist disparaging one demographic military force cultural marxism place armed forces last thing need office diversity equity inclusion department defense cover enabling radicalsit long ago military focused combat readiness capability capacity fulfill mission secretary defense served ft bragg nc issuing memorandums telling members military get used troops suffering gender dysphoria entering shower latrine facilities basically female troops told biological men naked showering adult want play make believe fine go ahead happening military well american taxpayer responsible subsidizing hormonal therapies surgical procedures individuals affected mental conditionthe previous diagnosis american psychiatric associationjust past week united states air force academy announced new rules promoting gender neutral language imagine usafa advises saying simple things mom dad advising cadets inquire persons desired pronouns making declarations months ago us navy issued video correct pronoun usage hmm remember interesting names drill sergeants would use inquire pronouns matter fact knucklehead gender neutral along stuck stupid seems lot military senior leadership timebut worrisome military illegal immoral unethical unconstitutional covid shot mandate forced upon servicemen women earlier month seven cadets us coast guard academy expelled refusing take jab occurred united states military academy west point aware countless stories men women uniform persecuted taking shot troops segregated deplorable living conditions treated like lepers constitutional rights denied religious exemptions share stories us american constitutional rights unions committee support defend americas constitutional conservative veterans organization,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

I'm a millenial as I'm 29 and I despise millenials.If we want to go by generational stereotypes, millenials are lazy, leftist, hipsters, who drink soy lattes and cancel people over twitter., Gen Z is super homosexual and transgender, etc.I'll take a boomer over my generation or gen z any day of the week. When they point out what ""boomers"" did in the 60s, they're basically talking about what hippies did, which 1) hippies were young at the time and young people are always idiots, but they were also a subset of that generation, not representative of all the boomers at the time and 2) that was a symptom of a culture that started to abandon God around that time, not the problem...the hippie marxist stuff was a symptom of us turning away from God.I really believe the whole boomer thing was a psy-op to get us to do what the left does, pointing the finger at a convenient target (in their case white people, in our case boomers)I remember when the boomer thing started and it's like it came out of thin air. The culture war was really starting to be won by Patriots, the tides were turning and most importantly, we were focused on the task, focused on the target (the cultural marxism everywhere)...and then suddenly, everyone started repeating ""ok boomer"" out of nowhere, and both the left and the right were doing it and our focus was diverted.When both the left and the right rally around a cultural talking point, you can be pretty sure you're being played.Take Pepe, the left hate pepe and call it a symbol of racism and whatnot, and pepe has been very effective for us, which is one way you know it's legitimate.Comparing that to the Karen memes which both the right and left use, there's a reason the left is ok with and just as frequently uses the ""Karen"" memes because it's a way to demonize suburban white women exclusively, when if a black woman behaved in the same way she's not called a Karen.Same with ""ok boomer"" the left is ok with it because it diverts the problem, gets people to look at a boogeyman rather than take personal responsibility.The left hates personal responsibility which is why they join hands with any meme that gets the right to create a boogeyman like the ""black community"" does. Because boogeymen destroy the movements/cultures that try and chase after them because those movements/cultures never end up cleaning up their own crap and instead focus on chasing that ever elusive and vague ""bad guy"". It's always ""the mans"" fault...but you can't ever fix ""the man"" but you can fix yourself.Even if boomers were the source of every problem we face (they're not, but just in a hypothetical), you could never do anything about that. The 60s are long gone, and it's like the black people forever obsessing about slavery. Neither black people nor us own a time machine so obsessing about a past event will only destroy you, rather than get you to fix yourself.",thank bob totally agree im millenial im despise millenialsif want go generational stereotypes millenials lazy leftist hipsters drink soy lattes cancel people twitter gen z super homosexual transgender etcill take boomer generation gen z day week point boomers theyre basically talking hippies hippies young time young people always idiots also subset generation representative boomers time symptom culture started abandon god around time problemthe hippie marxist stuff symptom us turning away godi really believe whole boomer thing psyop get us left pointing finger convenient target case white people case boomersi remember boomer thing started like came thin air culture war really starting patriots tides turning importantly focused task focused target cultural marxism everywhereand suddenly everyone started repeating ok boomer nowhere left right focus divertedwhen left right rally around cultural talking point pretty sure youre playedtake pepe left hate pepe call symbol racism whatnot pepe effective us one way know legitimatecomparing karen memes right left use theres reason left ok frequently uses karen memes way demonize suburban white women exclusively black woman behaved way shes called karensame ok boomer left ok diverts problem gets people look boogeyman rather take personal responsibilitythe left hates personal responsibility join hands meme gets right create boogeyman like black community boogeymen destroy movementscultures try chase movementscultures never end cleaning crap instead focus chasing ever elusive vague bad guy always mans faultbut cant ever fix man fix yourselfeven boomers source every problem face theyre hypothetical could never anything long gone like black people forever obsessing slavery neither black people us time machine obsessing past event destroy rather get fix,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

 That's your opinion, but I have a feeling the English one is simply more substantial because the conspiracy is more popular in the US. The term originated in the US, after all. When the wikipedia article says something like ""It has been described as 'a foundational element of the alt-right worldview',"" the author provides quotes to academic sources. In that quote's case, it is an academic study on [radicalization on 4chan](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-021-00732-x). Pretty funny to see 4chan comments in a peer-reviewed journal ain't it, but that's the kind of areas your research needs to examine when you're talking about a concept such as an American antisemitic conspiracy. Anyway, I think the fact that the English version mentions that it is a contemporary revival of the Nazi propaganda term ""cultural Bolshevism"" in the second paragraph is a good thing because that association should immediately alarm most rational people, while in the dutch article, it is not mentioned until the end of the first section, ""Origin and content."" Again, I don't think the English writers' awareness that its popularity in the US is an alarming problem due to its association with fascist propaganda is a bad thing, nor do I think it detracts from the article's content.
 
 &gt; Back to the point though, what would you prefer we call Cultural Marxists?
 
 There is no such thing as a ""cultural Marxist"". It's a conspiracy theory, end of story, the burden of proof is on you to prove the affirmative claim that they exist.
 
 &gt; To say ""well the nazis were opposed to something similar so that makes this label bad"" is a childish way to approach a label you don't like and has no effect besides making the other party come up with a new term
 
 They weren't ""opposed to something similar"", it was a term they used to denounce secularist, modernist and progressive cultural movements, like modern art, individualism, and democracy, and to otherize and ostracize those they accused of promoting it.
 
 &gt; The association of new art with Bolshevism circulated in right-wing and nationalist discourse in the following years, being the subject of a chapter in Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf. Amid Hitler's rise to power, the Nazis denounced a number of contemporary styles as ""cultural Bolshevism,"" notably abstract art and Bauhaus architecture... Once in control of the government, the Nazis moved to suppress modern art styles and to promote art with national and racial themes. ([From wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Bolshevism))
 
 Compared to the origin of the cultural Marxism conspiracy theory, the writings of Michael Minnicino in 1992:
 
 &gt; According to Minnicino, there are two aspects of the Frankfurt School plan to destroy Western culture: firstly, a cultural critique, by Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin, to use art and culture to promote alienation and replace Christianity with socialism, including the development of opinion polling to brainwash the populace and the development of advertising techniques to control political campaigning; and secondly, an attack on the traditional family structure by Erich Fromm and Herbert Marcuse by promoting women's rights, sexual liberation, and polymorphous perversity to subvert patriarchal authority
 
 So in yeah, I'm not arguing that the association with the Nazi term ""makes this label bad"", I'm arguing that each term was created to denounce secularist, modernist and progressive cultural movements, and they are each used by their proponents in identical manners to otherize people questioning traditional authority, so they are nearly synonymous and mostly different only in historical context.",gt huge difference english entry reads like opinion piece thats opinion feeling english one simply substantial conspiracy popular us term originated us wikipedia article says something like described foundational element altright worldview author provides quotes academic sources quotes case academic study radicalization chanhttpswwwnaturecomarticlessx pretty funny see chan comments peerreviewed journal aint thats kind areas research needs examine youre talking concept american antisemitic conspiracy anyway think fact english version mentions contemporary revival nazi propaganda term cultural bolshevism second paragraph good thing association immediately alarm rational people dutch article mentioned end first section origin content dont think english writers awareness popularity us alarming problem due association fascist propaganda bad thing think detracts articles content gt back point though would prefer call cultural marxists thing cultural marxist conspiracy theory end story burden proof prove affirmative claim exist gt say well nazis opposed something similar makes label bad childish way approach label dont like effect besides making party come new term werent opposed something similar term used denounce secularist modernist progressive cultural movements like modern art individualism democracy otherize ostracize accused promoting gt association new art bolshevism circulated rightwing nationalist discourse following years subject chapter adolf hitlers mein kampf amid hitlers rise power nazis denounced number contemporary styles cultural bolshevism notably abstract art bauhaus architecture control government nazis moved suppress modern art styles promote art national racial themes wikipediahttpsenwikipediaorgwikiculturalbolshevism compared origin cultural marxism conspiracy theory writings michael minnicino gt according minnicino two aspects frankfurt school plan destroy western culture firstly cultural critique theodor adorno walter benjamin use art culture promote alienation replace christianity socialism including development opinion polling brainwash populace development advertising techniques control political campaigning secondly attack traditional family structure erich fromm herbert marcuse promoting womens rights sexual liberation polymorphous perversity subvert patriarchal authority yeah im arguing association nazi term makes label bad im arguing term created denounce secularist modernist progressive cultural movements used proponents identical manners otherize people questioning traditional authority nearly synonymous mostly different historical context,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0

 Matthew Feldman and Maxime Dafaure disagree. From [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural\_Marxism\_conspiracy\_theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Marxism_conspiracy_theory) :
 
 &gt;In Fascism and Culture (2003), historian of fascism Matthew Feldman argues that the term Cultural Marxism is derived from the antisemitic term Kulturbolschewismus (Cultural Bolshevism), with which the Nazis claimed that Jewish cultural influence caused German social degeneration under the liberal r√©gime of the Weimar Republic (1918‚Äì1933) and was the cause of social degeneration in the West. Doctoral researcher Maxime Dafaure makes a similar point in ""The 'Great Meme War:' the Alt-Right and its Multifarious Enemies"" (2020).
 
 &amp;#x200B;
 
 &gt;Cultural Marxism is a school or offshoot of Marxism that conceives of culture as central to the legitimation of oppression, in addition to the economic factors that Karl Marx emphasized.
 
 This school of thought exist in your mind only.

They often hate oligarchs as much as any leftist. Some belong to unions. They may want things like M4A, or UBI. They might have different reasons for their economic beliefs, but they line up more closely with the populist left than the Neoliberal policies of austerity and corporatism.
 
 &amp;#x200B;
 
 If I could reinforce this point, which actually goes back to the OG NSDAP - the 'far right' aren't necessarily economically particularly right wing at all. The Political Compass describes their economical policy as 'broadly Keynesian', which we'd normally associated with centre-left or more redistributive forms of Liberalism like those practiced under FDR. Of course, these social programs would not be for Aryans. 
 
 The Nazis also had their Strasserite wing, which was so far-left economically you'd probably call them 'communists with aryan characteristics'. Apparently, leading figures like Ernst R√∂hm subsribed to this faction of the Nazi party, and thought their revolution wasn't complete until they'd completely ridded Germany of capitalism. No doubt they would've invoked numerous conspiracies about 'world jewry' and financial institutions. 
 
 And it persists - you can watch a BNP (British National Party, a neofascist political party) [youth video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_AEBldQ5T4&amp;t=108s) and if you removed the racism, a lot of the issues sounds like complaints you'd hear from the centre-left Labour Party\* - railing against austerity, bailing out bankers etc. Except the BNP blame the eternal bogeyman of 'Zionists' and 'Cultural Marxism' rather than neoliberal financial policy.
 
 \*This is **not** a backdoor criticism of Labour by association.
 
 I think the way to understand the far right is as a ill-defined group who's primary driver is opposition to immigration (from the 'bad' countries) and multi-racial democracy. The most extreme version of the codified ideology is probably the Great Replacement conspiracy theory, but there are lower tier versions that rely on misunderstanding of labour markets and immigration.

Cultural Marxism,2022-01-29,18:19:58,flecktarnbrother,Reddit,https://reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/sfjqja/meet_the_truckers_the_men_and_women_of_the/huqxkgf/,"I've posted this elsewhere for the sake of pushing out some actual information. So let's run down why this convoy is fucking dumb, and why it's not likely to achieve anything truly meaningful. What I've summarized is a bit long but I don't give a fuck. It should cover everything:
  
 
  
 1. There's rampant misinformation in the form of claiming to be larger than it actually is. Canadian police have estimated across numerous agencies that the convoy is no larger than 400 - 500 vehicles. And these aren't all semi-trucks; these are cars and light trucks as well. So these are not all truckers.
  
 
  
 2. They're protesting a Canadian mandate that, even if lifted, won't make a difference towards international trucking because the Americans have one of their own. It does not at all make sense to protest a partially American policy in Canada, which has no bearing on what Washington actually does.
  
 
  
 3. They're wanting the Senate and Governor General to dissolve government and appoint them to be a so-called ""Revolutionary Council"". This isn't how Canadian democracy works, and ironically, they're supposedly protesting against ""tyranny"" while aspiring to be tryants themselves.
  
 
  
 4. Social media posts have popped up, where they're likening themselves to Canadian soldiers as far as ""fighting for freedoms"" are concerned. Some of them have actually said insulting things towards the military and police, in spite of how supposedly ""patriotic"" they are. Some Confederate flags were flown from vehicles (the Confederacy were anti-freedom and allowed slavery), upside down Canadian flags and upside down Poppy flags were also flown. They're flagrantly disrespecting this country's soldiers, police and national symbols while hypocritically claiming to support them.
  
 
  
 5. The main protest is meant to happen on a Saturday, when public servants and other federal officials won't even be at Parliament Hill for work. Prime Minister Trudeau is isolating due to COVID-19, so he wouldn't be there anyway.
  
 
  
 6. The leaders and organizers of this convoy have ties to right-wing populist, white nationalist and conspiracy groups around Canada and the United States.
  
 
  
 7. If Canada truly were a tyrannical country, this convoy wouldn't have even begun. Organizers would've been arrested, sent to prison and/or executed for counter-revolutionary and/or subversive activities. The fact that this convoy exists means that Canada still maintains freedom of expression and assembly. But they'll allege that emergency health measures are a variety of Communism or ""Cultural Marxism"".
  
 
  
 To conclude:
  
 
  
 This is nothing more than a select group of right-wing political radicals from the working class who've been propagandized through Culture War narratives, conspiracy theories and Facebook misinformation. They are incredibly inconsistent from an ideological point of view, and while claiming to ""love their country"", are actively working against its interests. They're morally vacant hypocrites who are attempting to destabilize this country.

 I did give you a source, thats the case even if you arent able to summon it by some simple tapping into a search engine. 
 
 This may shock you but to this day the vast majority of academic work is conducted with references that one either have to visit a (often privilegied, meaning one must be enrolled) library or simply buy the cited work oneself. 
 
 In law school I had to not only buy about a thousand dollars or so worth of books per semester that was obligatory, I had to also buy another set of books worth at least twice that if I had any ambition to score higher than passing. 
 
 Would you have me just giving my professor a link to some archaic article I found on the web anytime I had to reach any kind of independent conclusion, or should I maybe have worked with the actual relevant corpus before I made any kind of argument or conclusion, even if it meant having to leave my appartment and touch some grass on my way to the uni library?
 
 &gt;Apparently you expect me to like buy this book
 
 So yes. Generally authors are expected to be compensated for their work. That goes doubly for academic works. 
 
 And something as little as having to buy one fricking book is fucking nothing if you want to treat this subject with the decorum that you pretend to think it deserves. 
 
 &gt;Unfortunate that you don't have the book nor do you understand what the book said nor do you remember anything from it otherwise you would have at least said the connections between them and could have attempted to fact check you.
 
 Christ. 
 
 Ping me the next holiday I visit my parents and I'll genuinelly dig it up to give you some specifics. 
 
 I read it about half a decade ago now so its fuzzy, but the gist as I remember it is that judeobolshevism was utilised by the nazis and their analogues in other nations prior to and during the war. 
 
 After the war the public use of the phrase/term died in Germany and allied nations, simmered quite publically still right under the surface, but as denazification took root over the little time it was in effect, and as the horrors of the holocaust dissiminated into the public consciousness, the term all but tied in any common company. But smaller groups, notably cops and certain military circles, retained the phrase. 
 
 In other neighbouring countries like Sweden, Finland, etc, the phrase continued in use and didnt really die down untill decades later with the decline of popularity in racial politics across the western world. (this is around the time of the civil rights movement in america, during that same time outwardly racist/nazi parties and policies also started to lose popularity in countries like, again, Sweden and Finland)
 
 With the beginning of the resurgence of strong radical right wing politics in the early 80s which would really top out in the 90s(although I believe the author also cites some alternative/precursor terms other than cultural marxism prior to the 80s, and for the alternatives some still lives on still), the same groups (notably, they are the same in that they are the same people that were members of both, officially openly nazi groups in say Sweden always officially disbanded and instead formed ""proud swedish"" parties, the current Swedish Democrats can be traced to this process aswell) would start replacing clearly anti-semitic terminology for dog whistles, and it was in this instance that judeobolshevism would come to be replaced, with entirely the same usage and framing, with cultural marxism. 
 
 The justification of the term originating from the Frankfurt school is as I understand a post hoc justification, merely grabbed onto after the cultural marxism as a term found organic footing. 
 
 &gt;Also John Brenkman is also a historian.
 
 &gt;""John Brenkman is an American historian of American literature
 
 Yes and no offence but an historian specialised in american literature wont know comparably shit all about a up untill recently overwhelmingly european (specifically germanic/north germanic) phenomenom that holds far more relevance in the political/ideological/cultural historical fields than in literature history of all things. 
 
 To really round out this comment. What you are doing here is akin to defending Petersons claims (fromt he 90s) that canada would be overrun by maoists by the turn of the millenia, with the fact that ""he is after all an academic"".

The Pagan's were a 'religious affirmation of Life, of the whole of Life, not of denied and partial Life.' A religious affirmation of Life (Life with a capital L). I think he envisions a world that is animated and magical, where life itself is ART! Here he gives an example of it being done through religion. A religious affirmation, but more importantly, is it even possible to do it without religion?This is the problem I have on my mind now. Many of the people that I see calling themselves Nietzscheans, say that God is dead, that there is no God. They proclaim that they will create their own values. And yet, I have not see them doing so whatsoever. I have never seen an example of this occurring. But even if I could see the way in which one has changed from pursuing this, I could be convinced. I would be able to see that they are rising to something greater, simply from the personal change that has occurred in them. However, I have never seen this, not in the slightest! In fact many of them simply become egoists (In the stirner sense) and then hedonists.But who can blame them! In a materialist world, it is difficult if not impossible to cultivate this affirmation. Materialism implies atheism, because unless your God is entirely physical, and I have never heard of such a thing, then there cannot be a God. Without a God, there is no inherent meaning, you must create it. You are an evolved animal, just a series of chemical reactions, you live for one life, and then you die forever. And so the natural conclusion that the majority come to is that you should seek as much pleasure as possible while you live. You should always act in your own self interest (egoism). To me it seems as though 'killing God' is only bringing us closer to the last man. I do not even know why, but these thoughts consume me, I MUST answer these questions. I feel that which I am looking for in the Greeks and Romans. I see it personified. I even see it in the great epics of the past. And slowly I see it disappearing. We have less God then ever in our society. Why are we no closer to the Ubermensch? Unless what we have now is a sort of atheistic slave morality? I have heard people say that socialism came from Christianity's dead corpse, but is socialism really the evolution of slave morality? What about in countries that aren't socialist, countries that are capitalist? How could you charge them with a socialist slave morality? I live here in the west, and yet I still feel it too! Unless you try to argue that it is some sort of cultural marxism (gramscism) that has taken place as the next slave morality, but at this point, I am throwing darts with a blindfold.

If the allied soldiers could see what their supposed victory brought upon their nations, they would not have fought.Hitlers last speech:German Volksgenossen! National Socialists!Twelve years ago, when, as the leader of the strongest party I was entrusted by the deceased Reich President, Paul von Hindenburg, with the office of Chancellor, Germany found herself faced with the same situation internally as the one that today faces it externally.The forces of economic destruction and annihilation of the Versailles dictate led to a situation that had gradually become a permanent one-namely, the existence of almost 7,000,000 unemployed, 7,000,000 part-time workers, a destroyed farmers class, a ruined industry and a commerce that had become correspondingly prostrate.The German ports were nothing but ship cemeteries. The financial situation of the country threatened at any moment to lead to a collapse not only of the state but also of the provinces and of the communities. The decisive thing, however, was this: Behind this methodical destruction of Germany's economy, there stood the specter of Asiatic bolshevism. It was there then, just as much as it is there today.In the years before our assumption of power the bourgeois world was incapable of opposing this development effectively on a small scale, just as it is incapable of doing so today on a large scale. Even after the collapse of 1918 this bourgeois world had failed to realize that an old world was vanishing and a new one being born and that there is no use in supporting and thus artificially maintaining what has been found to be decayed and rotten, but that something healthy must be substituted for it. A social structure that had become obsolete had cracked and every attempt to maintain it was bound to fail.It was no different today on a large scale, when the bourgeois states are doomed and when only clearly defined and ideologically consolidated national communities can survive the most difficult crisis Europe has seen in many centuries.We were granted only six years of peace after jan 30, 1933. During these six years tremendous feats were achieved, and even greater ones were planned, so many and such huge ones that they caused envy among our democratic impotent neighbors. But this was decisive: That we succeeded during these six years, with superhuman exertions, to restore the German nation militarily - that is, to imbue it with the spirit of resistance and self-assertion rather than to equip it with a material war potential.The horrid fate that is now taking shape in the east and that exterminates hundreds of thousands in the villages and the market places, in the country and in the cities will be warded off in the end and mastered by us, with the utmost exertion and despite all setbacks and hard trials. But if this is possible at all, it is only because a change has taken place in the German people since 1933.It is hardly necessary to argue with those eternal blockheads who maintain that an unarmed Germany would, owing to its impotence, not have become the victim of this jewish international world plot. Since when does the fox not kill the defenseless goose just because the goose is not aggressive by nature, and since when does a wolf become a pacifist because sheep do not wear armor? If there are still bourgeois states who earnestly believe this, that only proves how necessary it was to do away with an era that by its educational system managed to cultivate and maintain such notions, nay, even granted them political influence.The fight against this jewish asiatic bolshevism had been raging long before National Socialism came into power. The only reason why it had not already overrun Europe during the years 1919-20 was that it was then itself too weak and too poorly armed. It's attempt to eliminate Poland was not abandoned because of its compassion for the Poland of that time but only because the lost battle before Warsaw. It's intention to annihilate Hungary was not discarded because they changed their minds, but because bolshevist power could not be maintained militarily. Nor was the attempt to smash Germany given up because this achievement was not desired but because it proved impossible to overcome the natural resistance stamina of our people.Thereupon Judaism began systematically to undermine our nation from within, and it found its best ally in those narrow-minded bourgeois who would not recognize that the era of a bourgeois world is ended and will never again return, that the epoch of unbridled economic liberalism has outlived itself and can only lead to its self-destruction and, above all, that the great tasks of our time can be mastered only under an authoritarian coordination of natural strength, based on the law of same rights for all and, thence, of same duties. On the other hand, the fulfillment of the same duties must necessarily entail an equality of rights. Thus National Socialism, in the midst of gigantic economic, social and cultural reconstruction work has also educationally given to the German people that armor without which no military values can be created.The power of resistance of our nation has grown so tremendously since Jan 30, 1933, that it can no longer be compared with the earlier epoch, this power of resistance is the surest guarantor of the final victory. If Europe today finds itself the victim of a serious illness, then the affected countries will either have to overcome it by summoning their entire and utmost power of resistance, or they will be doomed. Yet the convalescent and survivor overcomes the climax of such an illness only in a crisis, a crisis that utterly weakens him, but in spite of all, it is all the more our immutable will not to shrink from anything in this struggle to rescue our people from this most gruesome fate of all time, and to obey steadfastly and the commandment of the preservation of our nation.The fact that this defense is fraught with incalculable misery, suffering and hardships makes us even more attached this nation. But it also gives us that hard will needed to fulfill our duty even in the most critical struggle; that is, not only to fulfill our duty toward the decent, noble Germans, but also our duty toward those few men without honor who divorce themselves from their people. In this fateful battle there is therefore for us but one command: He who fights honorably can thus save his own life and the lives of his loved ones. But he who, because of cowardice or lack of character, turns his back on the nation, will under any circumstance die a shameful death.That National Socialism succeeded in awakening and strengthening this spirit in our German people is a great achievement. Only when this mighty international drama will have died away and the bells of peace are ringing will realization come of what the German people owes to this spiritual rebirth: No less than its existence in this world.Only a few months and weeks ago allied statements openly outlined the German fate. Thereupon they were warned by some newspapers to be more intelligent and rather to promise something, even though nobody intended to keep this promise later. As a relentless National Socialist and fighter for my people, I now wish to assure these statesmen once and for all that every attempt at influence National Socialist Germany through slogans, lies and distortions presupposes a simple-mindedness unknown to the Germany of today.The fact that political activities and lies are inextricably linked in a democracy is of no consequence. Decisive is that every promise given by these statements to a people is today quite meaningless, because they are not in a position ever to fulfill any such promise. This is as if one sheep promised another sheep to protect it against a tiger.I herewith repeat my prophecy:England will not only not be in a position to control bolshevism but her development will unavoidably evolve more and more toward the symptoms of this destructive disease. The democracies are unable to rid themselves now of the forces they summoned from the steppes of asia. All the small European nations, who capitulated, confident of allied assurances, are facing complete annihilation. It is entirely uninteresting whether this fate will befall them a little earlier or later; what counts is its implacability.The kremlin jews are motivated only by tactical considerations; whether in one case they act with immediate brutality or, in another case, with some reticence, the result will always be the same. Germany, however, shall never suffer this fate. The guarantor thereof is the victory achieve twelve years ago within our country. Whatever our enemies may come up with, whatever sufferings they may cause on our German cities, on German landscapes, and above all, on our people, all that cannot bear any comparison with the irreparable misery, the tragedy that would befall us if the plutocratic-bolshevik conspiracy were victorious.Therefore, it is all the more necessary on this twelfth anniversary of the rise to power to strengthen heart more than ever before and to harden oneself in the sacred resolve to take up arms, no-matter where and under what circumstances, until final victory crowns our efforts.On this day I do not want to leave any doubt about something else. Against an entire hostile world I once chose my road, according to my inner call, and strode it, as an unknown and nameless man, to final success; often they reported I was dead and always they wished I were, but in the end I remained victor in spite of all.My life today is with an equal exclusiveness determined by the duties incumbent on me. Combined, they are but one: To work for my people and to fight for it. Only He can relieve me of this duty who called me to it. It was Providence's hands to eliminate me through the bomb that exploded only one and a half meters from me on July 20, and thereby terminate my life's work. In the years to come I shall continue on this road, uncompromisingly safeguarding my people's interests, oblivious to all misery and danger, and filled with the holy conviction that God the Almighty will not abandon him who wanted nothing other all his life than to spare his people from a fate it had never deserved neither by virtue of its number nor by way of its importance.I therefore now appeal to the entire German people and to my old fellow-fighters and to all the soldiers to gird themselves with a yet greater, harder spirit of resistance, until we can again-as we did before- put on the graves of the dead of this enormous struggle a wreath inscribed with the words: ""AND YET YOU WERE VICTORIOUS."" I expect every German to do his duty to the last and that he be willing to take upon himself every sacrifice he will be asked to make; I expect of every healthy man that he risk life and limb in this battle. I expect the sick and the weak or those otherwise unavailable for military duty to work with their last strength; I expect city dwellers to forge the weapons for this struggle and I expect the farmer to supply the bread for the soldiers and workers of this struggle by imposing restrictions upon himself; I expect all women and girls to continue supporting this struggle with utmost fanaticism.In this appeal I particularly address myself to the German youth. By forming such a committed community, we have the right to step before the almighty and ask Him for His mercy and blessings. No people can do more than that everybody who can fight, fights, and that everybody who can work, works, and that they all sacrifice in common, filled with but one thought: to secure freedom, national honor and thus the future of life.No matter how grave the crisis may be at this moment, we will overcome it in the end, in spite of everything, thanks to our unchangeable will, our readiness to sacrifice, and our abilities.

 But where does this come from?
 
 How does a race go from colonizing the whole fucking planet and thinking that non-whites are inferior, to self-hating and wanting to give up its own land?
 
 
 
 This cannot be a natural development. It's just too rapid. 
 
 
 
 Then, if you look at exactly who peddles anti-white hatred and white guilt, you find that they are all Jews. Who pushed to open the floodgates to mass immigration of non-whites? Jews. Do you want me to give you some names?
 
 Most people on here know about Cultural Marxism and Critical Theory, right? Well, it comes from the Frankfurt School. Which is Jews.
 
 
 
 So it's just a matter of putting 2 and 2 together:

Cultural Marxism,2022-09-17,15:05:00,MindCom,Minds,https://www.minds.com/newsfeed/1417889086550577157,"Every action you take to educate yourself, any action that is taken to help educate others on these topics, no matter how small, helps to bring an end to slavery and human suffering from servitude. Together, if we can understand what is happening on the earth and open our eyes to actually see these hidden agendas of Satanism and Luciferianism, across all paths, we can unite to end human slavery for the future generations ‚Äî Do Your Work!What are the primary goals and methods used by the NAA and Power Elite in their quest to fulfill the Luciferian Covenant and install the New World Order, a totalitarian and dystopian nightmare of consciousness enslavement?Many people still believe that the current state of world suffering, poverty, disease and violence was created accidentally, and that what we see today in the globalscape was the organic evolution of humanity since the industrial age. This is inaccurate. The Power Elite families have methodically and patiently grown their global agenda through specific objectives, which they sought to create through the use of Social Engineering and hidden technological Mind Control, along with gaining surveillance over our every move. Let‚Äôs review a brief summation of these goals.‚ûù Main Goals of Controllers:‚ûù Before and during World War II, the Black Suns promoted German idealism into mind control via their Social Engineering experiments designed by their German academic counterparts that were the most revered and famous philosophers during that time. These guys were Black Suns connected to the Bavarian illuminati and were used to infiltrate the most prestigious academic institutions worldwide with deliberate misinformation that would eventually be spread as the standard curriculum in most colleges. Many of these social engineering programs got their start from the Institute for Social Research, Frankfurt School, which was used by the Black Suns and practicing Satanists to endorse and spread a faux communist ideology that was really designed as a eugenics program. This Black Sun flavor of social engineering experimentation is being used aggressively today to target prestigious academic institutions throughout the United States, with the hidden agenda to attempt to destroy the American Constitution in favor of Socialism or Communism, in order to rapidly enforce the globalist agenda for instituting the New World Order.‚ûù Intentionally directing Social Engineering and mind control programming to dehumanize and demoralize the earth population, by denying them their basic rights to fundamental human needs and to generate depravity through increasing criminal behaviors, traumatic addiction, suicides and growing the homeless population. This includes propaganda to spread spiritually abusive behaviors as socially acceptable in the death culture, like legalized drugs, killing others, pornography and prostitution that are distractions from becoming aware that the earth is being used as a prison farm for creating more loosh for the predatorial parasites.‚ûù Promote spiritual abuse and the rejection of God by spreading the anti-soul or anti-Christ religions and their related practices that destroy the inner spirit or inner Christ connection, that exists inside every angelic human being that is incarnated on the planet. Spread violent religions, and replace the ancient Christos Essene Gnostic teachings and call it Luciferianism.‚ûù Control the weather and climate by intentionally poisoning and polluting the earth and natural resources through hidden technology and secret military agendas, in order to make these resources as scarce as possible, while spreading misinformation in the mainstream about environmentalism and climate changes. Use people‚Äôs genuine concern about the environment as a way to manipulate the unaware population into approval for directing tax payer‚Äôs dollars and massive funding into the Controller‚Äôs inverted systems, via their organized institutions to launder money into approved projects like chemtrailing and gang stalking. These schemes are designed to profit a few in order to protect the major industrial conglomerates, while actually enforcing and promoting policies that destroy the environment, rather than protect the earth‚Äôs environment.‚ûù Systematic globalization agenda and economic terrorism used to eventually collapse the global economies in order to generate chaos and world-wide humanitarian crisis. To achieve this goal, the Controllers must patiently orchestrate their covert agenda to infiltrate all world governments, divide and conquer independent nations by destroying them from within their own country, carried out by their own people. The first stages of this agenda are to fully exploit cheap labor by forcing indentured servitude in the impoverished populations of less developed nations, while cultivating more debt slaves in the first world nations, in order to destroy the economic stability and financial power, to collapse the autonomy of that nation. This is designed to force economic, political and societal collapse in order to force all nations into dependence and collusion with the One World Order agenda.‚ûù Control the bio-neurology of the human population through electromagnetic signals, prescription drugs, medical devices, GMO‚Äôs, and an assortment of toxins and poisons placed in the air, water and food supply, that generate many human diseases, while ensuring that the knowledge to cure these diseases is made unavailable to the masses.‚ûù Promote disinformation and suppression of accurate knowledge within the hard sciences, academia, inventions, and advanced technologies with the exception of those that are approved to promote the death culture objectives of the NAA and Controller groups.‚ûù Consistently control the mass perception of reality to be created in terrorism, cataclysm and pestilence fear programming that is carried out through the beliefs held in the biblical revelations, through an artificial mind control program known as Armageddon Software. Armageddon programs are designed to trigger subconscious memories in the collective consciousness, of previously hidden timelines of traumatic devastation that was caused by the NAA, such as the warring events that took place during the Luciferian Rebellion and Atlantian Cataclysm. This keeps people in a constant state of survival and poverty consciousness, unable to develop the personal strength required to cultivate self-determination and personal sovereignty.‚ûù The use of inverted systems in the non-profit organizations and religious institutions that are set up as storefronts used for international money laundering or criminal activities under the guise of humanitarian causes or charities, when the funds are collected for the express purposes to continue to enforce human misery and human suffering.‚ûù Transhumanism and Transgenderism are used to further promote the death culture‚Äôs intended agenda to destroy the heart and Soul, the compassionate and empathic divine human being, through the intended annihilation of the true essence of both the Masculine and Feminine. In order to disrupt or destroy the unifying potential of the androgynous lightbody in the DNA of the human being, the first directive would be to attack the inner and outer gender principle in all ways possible. The NAA promote counterfeit creations through inciting confusion in the death process, obliterate the knowledge of the Lightbody and Soul, spin confusion in sexual conduct and concepts of marriage and children, instill gender confusion in expected roles, and then start to blend human bodies with animals and machines.‚ûù Child Abuse and Child Sacrifice is an Archontic Deception Strategy of the NAA. The NAA and Satanists prefer to use children as targets in order to harvest negative emotional energy or Loosh, and as a result, child abuse, child sex slavery, child porn, child organ harvesting and child sacrifice are immensely profitable for those in the criminal network.‚ûù The mind control used for gender reversal distortions are the most traumatizing, from painful memories existing between men and women being forced to abuse each other, over and over. These gender distortions have been used to propagate some of the deepest levels of spiritual abuse, Sexual Misery and personal torture that could occur to a race of beings. True spiritual marriage as a part of natural biological spiritual Ascension was stolen from humanity through the NAA alien invasion, and the pain of that theft and the emotional abuse has damaged many people‚Äôs hearts.‚ûù Human Trafficking is the sale or barter for humans into slavery by other humans and non-humans. This is a massive epidemic on planet earth, and it also exists off planet earth and is referred to as Galactic Human Slavery. Generally, a person is culled for certain purposes and then abducted, captured from their families and sold or bartered for many purposes including manual slave labor, sex trade, engineering, and manufacturing. The person is mind controlled under a system of threats, intimidation and torture to remain compliant and submissive to the acts they are forced to perform for their handlers, who may be human or non-human entities. In poverty stricken third world countries, or during mass migration of refugees, children are grabbed from inattentive parents or offered a few hundred dollars to take their child. This level of human trafficking brings in many hundreds of thousands of people per year into the slave trade both on and off planet.Currently, the World Slavery system is used to parasitize soul energy but also to superimpose karmic exchanges on the masses, and is an important reason the NAA fight so hard to retain their control and access over earth and the trafficking of its inhabitants. It is estimated that at least 8 million children worldwide go missing each year. It is estimated that nearly 800,000 children will be reported missing each year in the USA; 40,000 children go missing each year in Brazil; 50,500 in Canada; 39,000 in France; 100,000 in Germany; and 45,000 in Mexico. An estimated 230,000 children go missing in the United Kingdom each year, or one child every 5 minutes.Ask yourself the Question:Who is benefiting from the enslavement of human beings on planet earth?Who is benefiting by having sex with our children?‚ûù Culture WarsThe current Culture Wars are using aggressive mind control tactics to purposely attack Individualism, Autonomy and Self-Leadership, to cultivate a generation of non-critical thinkers who automatically follow collectivism, coercion and blind obedience to another level of global tyranny. The problem, reaction, solution stage is being set, pushing for another round of Cultural Marxism or socialism instigated from the World War era, designed to fulfill the satanic collectivist nightmare of the New World Order. ‚ûù Controller Agenda is NWOIn our planet today, we have levels of geometric architecture, you might hear about the Vesica Pisces, ‚ÄúVP Network‚Äù or dodecahedron and pentagonal controls over carbon matter. These alien structures are AI systems that build binary Bi-wave Geometric Systems that have been installed in the planetary brain to create a certain low level frequency field, movement directing energy in the field, in terms of how energetic current is projected throughout the planet in Ley Lines and meridian systems. So these geometries actually are a part of the program that is the governance of where these energies are directed and what they‚Äôre used for. This is the game with the Negative Alien Agenda, with the artificial architecture which collects energy, harvests it, and sends it to off-planet sources, or to their preferred people, namely the Milab, Secret Societies and the New World Order group that are carrying out the controller agenda. So those collective energies are collected and basically given, with preference, to the beings who have sold out humanity and serve whatever their Control based agenda is.‚ûù 911 Timelines of War, CataclysmSuns of Belial, the Nibiru-Annunaki reptilians of the New World Order or NWO crews of the 911 Timelines Agendas, have headquartered themselves in the 11th Stargate of the United Kingdom and Stonehenge. These are the creators of the teeth chomping technology of the Nephilim Reversal Grid (NRG). Comprising primarily of Fallen Elohim genetic lines, this reversal network was a rebellion to the hybridization attempts of Lyran-Elohim races, who were responsible in commissioning Nephilim races for genetic DNA hybridization healing. The failure of that program, the banishment of Nephilim (The Giants) and killing of that race, resulted in Nephilim Wars, and subsequently, the NRG was placed in the UK land mass to reverse all pair bonded hybridized genetics, especially any genetic material (like the Krystal DNA Matrix) that was designed to unify or marry genetics in hierogamy or embodied Hieros Gamos.‚ûù Negative Aliens and NWOBecause the planet is ready to collapse timelines from the previous 3D cycle where the planet is playing out as the result of the Luciferian Rebellion from Atlantean time cycle, there is a struggle to dominate upcoming events that would influence these future timelines to be solely in Negative Alien or the NAA control. These groups have infighting, and the two primary groups have infected their headquartered control mechanism in two major stargates and power vortexes on the planet. Black Sun Program have headquartered themselves in the 10th Stargate or Iran Gate of the Golden Eagle Grid and lodged their technologies in Iraq/Iran to gain dominance over the power spots in Giza, Egypt. Most of them are Reptile Insectoid Collectives that are sourcing from out of the Phantom Matrix spaces in the parallel systems, and formed alliances with the Fallen Angelic Annunaki Groups to take control over the earth, which are referred to as the NAA. This is why they chose these areas of the planet to dominate, it was easier to invade from the genetic key level. The Sons of Belial, the Nibiruian-Annunaki reptilians of the New World Order crews that engineered the 911 Timelines Agenda, have headquartered themselves in the 11th Stargate area in the United Kingdom, this is also known as Stonehenge.‚ûù Adam Belial 9-11 Ritual for NWOApparently, it is believed when the luciferian ritualist opens the portal of Daath, the heart complex and physical heart chambers are filled with life force, which supposedly grows a soul from those sacrificed and harvested, on behalf of those who are soul-less. For those of us aware that the Sons of Belial are behind the New World Order and the 911 Timelines, it becomes clearer that humanity was held captive at a global scale, to witness the sophisticated orchestration of an Adam Belial Luciferian ritual that destroyed the Twin Towers and killed many innocent people for the purpose of Blood Sacrifice for the soul-less.The Belial Program described is one faction of the NAA attempting to force the planet to serve the multiple invading species agenda, through imposing artificially replicated time fields, inverting the system and generating a false reality based upon masterful lies, deceptions and illusions. ‚ûù What is the Space Fence?Although the USAF and Lockheed Martin tell us that the purpose of the Space Fence is to detect, track and catalog space debris, we must acknowledge that the MIC (Military Intelligence Complex) is at the helm of the New World Order and is routinely engaged in Psychological Operations against the rest of the population. See Frequency (Static) Fences.‚ûù Armageddon SoftwareThe Armageddon Software Mind Control programs, such as War (Terrorism), Pestilence and Cataclysm fears, or many other fear programs which can be interchanged as they are similar bio-warfare Mind Control programs used on the earth to suppress and control human consciousness by propagating artificially generated False Timelines. This is a Psycho-Spiritual Warfare strategy used against humanity by the Negative Aliens through their False Gods and False Father Satanic religions to use SRA to repeatedly enslave, kill and torture humans through Religious Violence and Military control through terrorism, war and population control, in which their goal is to institute global tyranny via the New World Order.The Armageddon Software is the enslavement companion Mind Control system which is activated through the Crucifixion Implants in Holographic Inserts embedded into the planetary body and human body. The Armageddon Software is a mind control program to terrorize humanity through enforcing the militarization of planet earth and is carried out through Military Grey Alien Technology and the continual development of the hidden underground and space alien technology war machine agenda.‚ûù Global Human SlaveryCurrently, the World Slavery system is used to parasitize soul energy but also to superimpose karmic exchanges on the masses, and is an important reason the NAA fight so hard to retain their control and access over earth and the inhabitants. The humans controlled by the NAA have Stockholm Syndrome, and have been dehumanized to such levels of fragmentation they act like a feral animal cornered in a cage, defending their enslavement, not comprehending how they can exist any way else but to be in the Mind Control matrix enmeshed in a codependent Parasitism with these dark forces.‚ûù Treaty of AltairThe NAA effectively declared an edict of war against the Christos Founders, and all of the Maji Grail King lines, Indigos, as well as the earth population on September 12, 2000. Exactly one year later they staged an Adam Belial ritual in order to institute a public ceremony announcing their New World Order plan with the culmination of the tragic events of September 11, 2001 in New York City. The destruction of the Twin Towers and Blood Sacrifice of those killed at the World Trade Center, was intended to be the line drawn in the sand to show the NAA were proceeding with their full domination and slavery agenda of humanity and earth. This event brought forward what became known as the 911 Timelines, the institution of the false reality timelines in order take the planet into AI Assimilation Timeline which is the Fallen AI Timeline Loops that the NAA fully control from within the Phantom Matrix. ‚ûù One World OrderThe current chaotic events that are being revealed in the globalscape drama are designed to perpetuate mass psychological operations against the earth inhabitants that ultimately serve the objectives of those negative Controlling forces, competing to succeed in their version of the One World Order agenda. The purposeful orchestration of controlling mass perception through the intentional spreading of a genetically modified biological weapon to unleash a global pandemic, is setting the stage for the

Before the Commies cry ‚Äúantisemite!‚Äù, ‚ÄúAntisemitism‚Äù is right there with ‚Äúracist‚Äùand all of the other divisive Communist tactics. Let‚Äôs look at some History, shall we? Gentleman's Agreement¬†is a 1947 American¬†drama film¬†‚Ä¶It concerns a journalist (Gregory Peck) who poses as a Jew to research an expos√© on the widespread¬†distrust and dislike of Jews¬†in New York City‚Ä¶ won three Oscars‚Ä¶The movie was controversial in its day, as was a similar film on the same subject,¬†Crossfire, which was released the same year (though that film was originally a story about anti-homosexuality, later changed to antiSemitism).Studio HEADS of Pedowood‚Äôs ‚ÄúGolden Age‚Äù; From their wikipedia pages: Harry Cohn¬†(Columbia) Cohn was born to a working-class Jewish family in New York City.[2]¬†His father, Joseph Cohen, was a tailor from Germany, and his mother, Bella Joseph, was from¬†Pale of Settlement,¬†Russian Empire.Louis B. Mayer Mayer was born in the¬†Russian Empire¬†Jack Warner¬†(Warner Bros) Jacob Warner‚Ä¶ parents were¬†Polish-Jewish immigrants from¬†Congress Poland¬†(then part of¬†Russian Empire) ,David O. Selznick His parents were¬†Lithuanian Jews, and he had four siblings. His father was born in¬†Lithuania¬†in 1870. He studied at¬†Columbia University¬†in¬†New York City¬† Selznick added the ""O"" to distinguish himself ‚Ä¶Carl Laemmle, Jr.¬†(Universal) born in 1867 to a¬†Jewish¬†family in¬†Laupheim, in the German¬†Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg.Barney Balaban¬†(Paramount) : Barney Balaban (formerly Birnbaum) was the eldest of the seven sons of Bessarabian Jewish immigrants. Coming to America - the National Socialists came to power in Germany in 1933. It was a bad time and place to be a Jewish Marxist, as most of the school‚Äôs faculty was. So, the school moved to New York City, the bastion of Western culture at the time.Max Horkheimer¬†was a dedicated Marxist who helped to create what is known as Critical Theory through radical Marxism. In 1930 he joined with a Marxist study group, started by Felix Weil, which evolved into the Institute for Social Research and is now known as the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory. Critical Theory maintains that ideology (Christianity) is the principal ‚Äúobstacle‚Äù to human liberation‚Ä¶In 1934, the Frankfurt School was reborn at¬†Columbia University. Its members began to exert their ideas on American culture. It was at Columbia University that the school honed the tool it would use to destroy Western culture: the printed word.The school published a lot of popular material. The first of these was¬†Critical Theory.Marcuse would be the one to answer Horkheimer‚Äôs question from the 1930s: Who would replace the working class as the new vanguards of the Marxist revolution? Marcuse believed that it would be a victim coalition of minorities‚Äîblacks, women, and homosexuals.The social movements of the 1960s‚Äîblack power, feminism, gay rights, sexual liberation‚Äîgave Marcuse a unique vehicle to release cultural Marxist ideas into the mainstream. Railing against all things ‚Äúestablishment,‚Äù The Frankfurt School‚Äôs ideals caught on like wildfire across American universities. https://archive.md/wip/54cCP *https://www.thestandardsc.org/david-galland/the-birth-of-cultural-marxism-how-the-frankfurt-school-changed-america/This guy has a U.S. Stamp , and schools named after him: Columbia University and Communism In 1923 Paul Robeson received his law degree from Columbia. He turned from law to show business and was soon using his fame to promote and support Communist causes. In 1934 he went on a pilgrimage to the Soviet Union. In 1952 the Soviet government awarded him its¬†Stalin Peace Prize. In 1954 he wrote a magazine article in praise of Vietnamese Communist leader Ho Chi Minh, who would soon be fighting a war against the United States. https://archive.md/wip/RBqgK * https://historyhalf.com/columbia-university-and-communism/",time part russian empiresounds alltoo familiar commies cry ‚äúantisemite‚äù ‚äúantisemitism‚äù right ‚äúracist‚äùand divisive communist tactics let‚äôs look history shall gentlemans agreement¬†is american¬†drama film¬†‚ä¶it concerns journalist gregory peck poses jew research expos√© widespread¬†distrust dislike jews¬†in new york city‚ä¶ three oscars‚ä¶the movie controversial day similar film subject¬†crossfire released year though film originally story antihomosexuality later changed antisemitismstudio heads pedowood‚äôs ‚äúgolden age‚äù wikipedia pages harry cohn¬†columbia cohn born workingclass jewish family new york city¬†his father joseph cohen tailor germany mother bella joseph from¬†pale settlement¬†russian empirelouis b mayer mayer born the¬†russian empire¬†jack warner¬†warner bros jacob warner‚ä¶ parents were¬†polishjewish immigrants from¬†congress poland¬†then part of¬†russian empire david selznick parents were¬†lithuanian jews four siblings father born in¬†lithuania¬†in studied at¬†columbia university¬†in¬†new york city¬† selznick added distinguish ‚ä¶carl laemmle jr¬†universal born a¬†jewish¬†family in¬†laupheim german¬†kingdom w√ºrttembergbarney balaban¬†paramount barney balaban formerly birnbaum eldest seven sons bessarabian jewish immigrants coming america national socialists came power germany bad time place jewish marxist school‚äôs faculty school moved new york city bastion western culture timemax horkheimer¬†was dedicated marxist helped create known critical theory radical marxism joined marxist study group started felix weil evolved institute social research known frankfurt school critical theory critical theory maintains ideology christianity principal ‚äúobstacle‚äù human liberation‚ä¶in frankfurt school reborn at¬†columbia university members began exert ideas american culture columbia university school honed tool would use destroy western culture printed wordthe school published lot popular material first was¬†critical theorymarcuse would one answer horkheimer‚äôs question would replace working class new vanguards marxist revolution marcuse believed would victim coalition minorities‚äîblacks women homosexualsthe social movements s‚äîblack power feminism gay rights sexual liberation‚äîgave marcuse unique vehicle release cultural marxist ideas mainstream railing things ‚äúestablishment‚äù frankfurt school‚äôs ideals caught like wildfire across american universities httpsarchivemdwipccp httpswwwthestandardscorgdavidgallandthebirthofculturalmarxismhowthefrankfurtschoolchangedamericathis guy us stamp schools named columbia university communism paul robeson received law degree columbia turned law show business soon using fame promote support communist causes went pilgrimage soviet union soviet government awarded its¬†stalin peace prize wrote magazine article praise vietnamese communist leader ho chi minh would soon fighting war united states httpsarchivemdwiprbqgk httpshistoryhalfcomcolumbiauniversityandcommunism,15,3,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0

Click to expand... Every Marxist, liberal and queer I've seen discuss this have given this response: ""social/cultural Marxism is not a real thing. It's a conspiracy theory by racists.

Cultural Marxism,2022-12-28,,martinezperspective vids,Telegram,https://t.me/mpvids/3558,"The point of this post was very simple: People should not blame the old order for the actions of those who overthrew it. As usual, the ""Third Positionists"" totally missed the point. These self-identified Socialists have spent the last few years claiming (without any empirical evidence) that Cultural Marxism does not exist and that we instead live under ""Cultural (Classical) Liberalism"" or ""Cultural Capitalism."" ""Leftists and non-Whites are not demolishing the West and peddling Globalism, it's those dang Anglo-American Liberal Free Market Capitalists!"" Before WW2 (or at least until around the Great Depression, when Socialists gained more influence), the ideology of the Anglosphere was unabashed White (Anglo-Saxon) supremacism, eugenics, scientific racism, segregation, anti-immigration and nativism, Christianity, strong families, and traditional culture. You'd have to be completely insane to believe that the system we live under today is remotely comparable in terms of economics or ideology. We have more regulations than ever before, big government-backed monopolies, private-public partnerships, bloated welfare states, massive taxes, massive global wealth redistribution from Whites to non-Whites, and Socialist (or ""Social Democratic"") parties dominating governments since the end of WW2. Even the so-called ""Capitalist"" elites of the WEF & Co. express their desire to abolish Capitalism. Furthermore, all of the theory that underpins so-called ""Cultural Liberalism"" was cooked up by Marxist academics and their students, not the corporate boardrooms of Fortune 500 companies. Noel Ignatiev, Franz Boas, Theo Adorno, Herbert Marcuse, Kim Crenshaw, Angela Davis, etc. are Socialist Third Worldists, not Classical Liberals. Plus, as I've repeatedly pointed out, postwar Globalist ideology has deep roots in the Socialist movement, dating back to the earliest Utopians and Radicals (I'll write an article on this topic soon). Modern ""Capitalists"" (corporations, businesses, etc.) parrot Cultural Marxist (""Woke"") ideals for a few reasons: 1. They're forced to do so by Civil Rights laws (enacted by Socialists & Social Democrat governments in the 60s/70s). 2. They're threatened by ""cancel culture"" enforced by Leftist media hegemony and NGOs like the ADL. 3. Leftist activists aggressively colonized corporations as part of their Long March Through The Institutions of Power. 4. Globalist elites (who take ideological cues from Leftist academia and from being predominantly ethnically Jewish) have bought up and monopolized corporations. 5. Too Big to Fail companies can push unprofitable ideological nonsense because they're supported by the state. 6. Companies are kept in line by private finance pressure, e.g. BlackRock's ESG which is a corporate Cultural Marxist social credit score. Corporations aren't special unique entities controlled by magical abstract economic wizardry, but nodes of power (like government, media, academia, or judiciary) that can be captured or dominated by ideologically-motivated parties and individuals. Finally, if Anglo-Saxon Classical Liberalism inevitably leads to Globalism and transgender toddlers due to some inherent ""structural flaw,"" then what does that imply for imperial monarchist countries, like Germany, Russia, and China? They succumbed to Leftism faster than any Anglo-Saxon state. Spain was a Fascist/monarchist country up until the late 70s but is now as Globalist as they come. Socialist ""Third Positionists"" want you to blame ""Anglo-American Liberal Capitalists"" for all of our woes because, in typical Leftist fashion, they are trying to sell a poison (Socialist Third Worldism) as its own antidote. They want the technocracy, the UBI, the bloated welfare state, to save all of the ""oppressed"" brown people around the world, and so on. This is why they downplayed or defended the COVID tyranny, claimed that Agenda 21 is irrelevant, tried to rehabilitate Socialist states (e.g. Yugoslavia), and idolize countries like Russia and China, both of which are anti-White, multiethnic/racial technocracies.",point post simple people blame old order actions overthrew usual third positionists totally missed point selfidentified socialists spent last years claiming without empirical evidence cultural marxism exist instead live cultural classical liberalism cultural capitalism leftists nonwhites demolishing west peddling globalism dang angloamerican liberal free market capitalists ww least around great depression socialists gained influence ideology anglosphere unabashed white anglosaxon supremacism eugenics scientific racism segregation antiimmigration nativism christianity strong families traditional culture youd completely insane believe system live today remotely comparable terms economics ideology regulations ever big governmentbacked monopolies privatepublic partnerships bloated welfare states massive taxes massive global wealth redistribution whites nonwhites socialist social democratic parties dominating governments since end ww even socalled capitalist elites wef co express desire abolish capitalism furthermore theory underpins socalled cultural liberalism cooked marxist academics students corporate boardrooms fortune companies noel ignatiev franz boas theo adorno herbert marcuse kim crenshaw angela davis etc socialist third worldists classical liberals plus ive repeatedly pointed postwar globalist ideology deep roots socialist movement dating back earliest utopians radicals ill write article topic soon modern capitalists corporations businesses etc parrot cultural marxist woke ideals reasons theyre forced civil rights laws enacted socialists social democrat governments ss theyre threatened cancel culture enforced leftist media hegemony ngos like adl leftist activists aggressively colonized corporations part long march institutions power globalist elites take ideological cues leftist academia predominantly ethnically jewish bought monopolized corporations big fail companies push unprofitable ideological nonsense theyre supported state companies kept line private finance pressure eg blackrocks esg corporate cultural marxist social credit score corporations arent special unique entities controlled magical abstract economic wizardry nodes power like government media academia judiciary captured dominated ideologicallymotivated parties individuals finally anglosaxon classical liberalism inevitably leads globalism transgender toddlers due inherent structural flaw imply imperial monarchist countries like germany russia china succumbed leftism faster anglosaxon state spain fascistmonarchist country late globalist come socialist third positionists want blame angloamerican liberal capitalists woes typical leftist fashion trying sell poison socialist third worldism antidote want technocracy ubi bloated welfare state save oppressed brown people around world downplayed defended covid tyranny claimed agenda irrelevant tried rehabilitate socialist states eg yugoslavia idolize countries like russia china antiwhite multiethnicracial technocracies,2,0,1,5,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

They think they are in a way‚Äî they gesture at class-adjacent social indicators. They criticize ‚Äúliberal elites;‚Äù fancy sociologically-informed leftist academics with all their book learning who they just assume must be part of the bad guy elite because they go to decent universities &amp; do research; ‚Äúcoastal elites,‚Äù gesturing at the proportion of wealthy people who live on the coasts in contrast to ‚ÄúFlyover‚Äù ‚ÄúReal America.‚Äù They‚Äôll criticize ‚Äúglobalism,‚Äù ‚Äúcultural Marxism,‚Äù all of which is dog whistley enough to functionally suggest both wealthy elites &amp;, slightly more subtly, the Jews (&amp; communists, as cultural Marxism is a conspiracy theory descended from the actual German Nazi conspiracy theory of ‚Äúcultural Bolshevism‚Äù which tied Jews &amp; communists together in a fabricated secret plot to destroy Germany. 
 
 So yes, populists recognize in some vague sense that the system is rigged, that wealthy elites are making a killing at the expense of middle class/working/poor Americans. But they define ‚Äúelite‚Äù all wrong, based on cultural signifiers that the hegemonic capitalist culture hands them through media &amp; political theater &amp; manufacture of consent. It‚Äôs always about their politics (the bad elite are arbitrarily assumed to be secret communists, because you know, communism is teh bad, we‚Äôre still living in Cold War propaganda world even though the Cold War has been over for 30 years, so anything bad is to be blamed on ‚Äútoo much government,‚Äù which in the doctrine of the American indoctrination system essentially is what people are taught to think communism means). 
 
 They have absolutely no actual class analysis‚Äî they have no awareness of class as such (the actual hierarchical social relation between those who own the means of production &amp; those who don‚Äôt, &amp; exploitation, &amp; all of that). Just a vague resentment of whatever wealthier people they think are keeping them from getting their due. They‚Äôll blame corporatism, ‚Äúcrony capitalism,‚Äù specific ‚Äúblack hat‚Äù billionaires like George Soros or the Rothschilds (not an accident that they chose those names, as this is VERY tied in with anti-Semitic conspiracy theories like the Nazi ‚ÄúJewish question,‚Äù even if most ‚Äúright-libertarian‚Äù or conservative types don‚Äôt realize the implications when they talk delusionally about ‚Äúcultural Marxism‚Äù or ‚Äúglobo-homo‚Äù agendas or whatever. 
 
 This is why they‚Äôre so vulnerable to scapegoating. In the absence of class consciousness that actually empowers you with an understanding of the nature of class relations, if you don‚Äôt understand how capitalism works or how power functions in our society or any of the history of economic development &amp; class struggle, then you can be duped into any narrative that suits your preconceived biases. You aren‚Äôt actually barely scraping by working two or three jobs for 50-80+ hours a week at jobs you hate for lower real wages than you would‚Äôve made on average 50 years ago because our economic &amp; political system are designed from the bottom up to profit &amp; empower a small ruling class, the capitalists, by virtue of their ownership of the means of production to the exclusion of the largely propertiless majority, which means this small economic ruling class ends up owning the entire economy (mostly in the hands of just a few hundred-billionaire mega-barons while hundreds of millions languish &amp; suffer deprivation &amp; anxiety &amp; depression &amp; miserable, monotonous, backbreaking lives of drudgery on someone else‚Äôs command &amp; have their supposedly at least partially democratic government bought out from under them/us). Actually, the reason for your suffering isn‚Äôt because of the powerful who actually control the institutions &amp; make the public policies that screw workers over, &amp; benefit from police &amp; military upholding capitalism, &amp; profit from exploiting waged workers, &amp; own practically everything of significance‚Ä¶ No, the true enemy is refugees, or immigrants, or foreign workers, or feminists, or cultural Marxists, or black people, or welfare queens, Muslims, Jews, LGBTQ people, pro-vaccine liberals, communists, socialists, anarchists, antifa, Bernie Sanders not being willing to ‚Äúconpromise &amp; reach across the aisle‚Äù by going along with the same neoliberal BS that‚Äôs been transferring wealth upward into fewer &amp; fewer hands since the 70s. Today it can be Mexican workers, tomorrow it can be Chinese workers, the next day it can be ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs all because women entered the workplace &amp; stole away your rightful role as the trad-husband male breadwinner because of uppity feminists.‚Äù The scapegoat doesn‚Äôt matter, because it isn‚Äôt true. It‚Äôs just a propaganda narrative, a fabricated antagonist to blame problems on, to redirect people‚Äôs legitimate grievances &amp; righteous indignation &amp; constructive efforts at organizing along class lines (labor organizing, developing left-wing labor-aligned political forces that can push back against pro-capital ones like they always have in some homeostatic balance in any actual representative government throughout history) away from the true antagonist of the working class‚Äî defined by material interests which are objectively, diametrically opposed to those of the working class. The people who actually profit more the less they pay you. The people whose entire class profits more if economic policy is designed to squash labor, suppress wages, squeeze more productivity out of workers for longer hours at lower pay, rather than pro-worker political forces creating policy which shifts power &amp; income distribution back in favor of the working class, which expends our shared public resources, which ought to overwhelmingly come from the handful of hundred-billionaires who literally possess almost all the wealth of our society at this point (3 individuals have more than the bottom 50‚Äì it‚Äôs unfashionable, so there you go, all those trillions of dollars stagnant in billionaires‚Äô savings accounts which could be out circulating among the working class, providing people with incomes &amp; buying power &amp; higher standards of living for shorter hours of required work exist‚Äî we have unreal levels of productivity with all the scientific revolutions of the last 100 years, so the workers are producing inordinate amounts of wealth, but it‚Äôs distributed so unfathomably unequally by our capitalist system as a result of the class divide &amp; ). Instead, if we directed a significant portion of that wealth towards priorities like meeting human need &amp; improving the well-being of everyone with obvious, rational policies like universal healthcare &amp; education &amp; housing, preventing climate change so that there is even a future for humanity, providing things people actually need which they‚Äôre currently going without because it isn‚Äôt sufficiently profitable for capitalists to provide them (or when they‚Äôre allowed to they commit absolute highway robbery, because the demand for basic necessities like life-saving healthcare is extremely inelastic, so not something the market can manage with supply &amp; demand), instead of the acting actual trillions on corporate welfare giveaways for already-rich capitalists &amp; imperialist wars for resources &amp; geopolitical domination of the globe under a US-ruled neoliberal global imperialist order (which benefit virtually no one except those few elite investors who already have more than they‚Äôll ever be able to spend at tremendous cost in suffering, lives, money, resources‚Äî instead, we could transform the America &amp; consequently the world for the better, probably at a fraction the cost (plus most of these social programs serve as economic stimulus &amp; provide crucial products/services‚Äî they‚Äôre investments that pay dividends, not just wasted money). 
 
 But any good future is going to HAVE to start with mass working class organizing &amp; class consciousness raising efforts, &amp; ultimately the working people of this country actually getting their hands back on the levers of power (through greater democracy, not historically failed Leninist/Marxist-Leninist dictatorship), because the ruling class will never prioritize anything but profit. It‚Äôs their institutional imperative, &amp; in the case of CEOs, their legal obligation. If they were going to do anything about climate change, they‚Äôd have done it by now‚Äî it‚Äôs 2022 ffs. They‚Äôve known since the 1970s how potentially devastating this could get if we kept down the path of oil/gas/coal extraction, &amp; they doubled down because they were bought by the fossil fuel lobby (now just fossil fuel corporations which, as ‚Äúpeople‚Äù (üò¨) now legally have the right to donate unlimited money to political campaigns as their ‚Äúfree speech‚Äù (üò¨) &amp; the billionaires who own the major stakes in most of the big ones. We need to make it happen with a rapidity &amp; magnitude we‚Äôre never seen in history if we‚Äôre going to avert the ‚Äúpoint of no return,‚Äù but if we‚Äôre going to succeed then we have to just act as if it is possible we will succeed‚Äî lay the groundwork, do the things that would be necessary for the good future to be realized.

Cultural Marxism,2022-07-27,16:26:12,abgreport,Minds,https://www.minds.com/newsfeed/1399065352947634181,"https://www.americaoutloud.com/pandemic-panic-theater-wokeness-and-economic-collapse-are-all-tied-together/The reason the Liberal World Order has its tentacles in so many arenas is simple. Against one existential threat, we can easily prevail. But when we‚Äôre faced with what we believe to be disparate challenges, we‚Äôre being divided as they attempt to conquer us. Recognizing that everything is tied together is important as we move forward to save this world and preserve American exceptionalism against the powers-that-be.On today‚Äôs episode of The JD Rucker Political Report, I explained why we need to take the totality of the plan to push us into The Great Reset and address it as a whole. That doesn‚Äôt mean we need to tackle all things at all times. Some are better suited to fight Cultural Marxism through protests of CRT, LGBTQIA+ supremacy, or the post-truth society in general. Others may have strengths in opposing the medical tyranny as Pandemic Panic Theater 2.0, and even 3.0 are rearing their ugly heads.All of it ties back to the goals of the Liberal World Order. Whether you call it The Great Reset, 4th Industrial Revolution, Build Back Better, or any of the various labels they change like colors on a chameleon, it‚Äôs all one giant conspiracy. They know they can weaken us by hitting us from multiple fronts simultaneously, so our fight is one that keeps us busy on our own preferred fronts while requiring that we support those fighting on our behalf on other fronts.Today, I discussed three of the primary fronts that made news this weekend. Well, ‚Äúwokeness‚Äù makes news nonstop as radical progressives flaunt their idiocy. Medical tyranny has been on the backburner, at least in the eyes of many patriots who became complacent and declared ‚Äúmission accomplished‚Äù in February or March when mandates started falling. This isn‚Äôt over. It‚Äôs ramping back up now.As for the economic collapse, there is not enough attention being paid to this likely possibility. We often assume that as a nation, we can make it through any downturn. We‚Äôve survived massive financial challenges in the past. But this one seems different. This one is being driven by very powerful people who want the U.S. Dollar to collapse to be replaced by Central Bank Digital Currencies. Unfortunately, some of those people are in our government right now.While reading through the parts of the stories below, keep in mind that the totality of events pushing us toward The Great Reset must be assumed as part of a unified plan by the Liberal World Order. If we pretend like they‚Äôre all separate issues, we will have zero chance of beating them.Medical TyrannyWill the next scamdemic be Omicron subvariant BA.5? It allegedly spreads faster than any previous variant, and while it‚Äôs considered to be the mildest, it‚Äôs still sparking medical tyranny to rise. Will it be Monkeypox? Around 98% of cases worldwide are in gay men, but both the World Health Organization and our own government are treating it like this is a major disease that‚Äôs coming for everybody.We need to be cognizant of not only what they want to push onto us next but also what sort of tyrannical actions will rise from it. An article by Ethan Huff over at Natural News below details what‚Äôs happening in Sri Lanka. Could that happen here? I would say it not only could happen but almost certainly will if we don‚Äôt address it now.COVID QR codes now being used to RATION FUEL in Sri Lanka as economic collapse acceleratesWe are hearing through the grapevine that Sri Lanka‚Äôs latest approach to handling the fuel crisis in its country is to ration fuel using residents‚Äô Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) QR codes.The only way to buy gasoline in Sri Lanka, we are told, is to show one‚Äôs COVID ‚Äúpassport‚Äù via a smartphone ‚Äì this being exactly the type of government misuse that many warned about when QR codes for the plandemic were first introduced.A type of the Mark of the Beast, COVID QR codes are a digital mark that must be shown in order to continue engaging in commerce, as fuel is needed to drive, as well as to create and transport goods and services.Russia‚Äôs ‚Äúspecial operation‚Äù in Ukraine is shouldering most of the blame for Sri Lanka‚Äôs current dire situation as the tiny country, located at the southern tip of India, struggles to maintain adequate gas supplies amid a global rush for gas.Prices for what little gas Sri Lanka has been able to procure are skyrocketing, and the government‚Äôs solution is to demand that residents show their COVID QR codes in order to partake (Related: Check out our earlier coverage about the Sri Lanka fuel protests to learn more about the spiraling situation in the Southeast Asian country).Is fuel rationing on the agenda for the rest of the world?It sounds as though the COVID QR code in Sri Lanka has been retooled as a gas rationing QR code, meaning residents are awarded access to fuel on some kind of rolling basis depending on available supplies.As some gas becomes available, in other words, certain residents are notified that they can show up to purchase gas ‚Äì just so long as their code has been ‚Äúactivated.‚Äù Those without an active QR code will not be allowed to purchase any gas.The below video, which was shared on Twitter, shows the process in action:https://twitter.com/risemelbourne/status/1550260973302607873Seeing as how covid QR codes were used in many other countries besides Sri Lanka, and seeing as how fuel shortages and inflation are now afflicting pretty much every country except Russia and its allies, it is safe to assume that this new imposition will spread to other countries.As the gas taps get shut off in Europe, for instance, there is a chance that Europeans in countries like Germany and The Netherlands could eventually be told that they, too, need to show their QR codes in order to heat their homes and businesses this winter.‚ÄúThey‚Äôll tighten the screws to do everything they can to get ppl onto the App,‚Äù tweeted someone named ‚ÄúGetBackToLife ‚Äì #NoJabsForKids‚Äù (@TinyFighterGirl).Someone else named ‚ÄúLuther‚Äù (@LutherBurgsvik) tweeted a link to FuelPass.gov.lk, though it does not seem to be accessible from anywhere outside of Sri Lanka ‚Äì except, perhaps, with a VPN (virtual private network) ¬¨‚Äì as the main page displays a message stating:‚ÄúNational Fuel Pass: You are not authorized‚Äù‚ÄúNo doubt, this is where civil war comes into play,‚Äù added the GetBackToLife Twitter account in a separate tweet.Another named ‚ÄúRozalyn Gracia‚Äù (@graccie_roz) tweeted that she believes Sri Lanka was ‚Äúintentionally staged to make way for this‚Äù as an example for the rest of the world to emulate as the economic dominoes continue to topple.‚ÄúThis is exactly the essence of Agenda 2030,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúGod help us if people don‚Äôt wake up in time.‚ÄùThe latest news about the engineered takedown of the world economy by globalists can be found at Rationing.news.Like I said, do not assume that just because it‚Äôs happening in a place like Sri Lanka that is very different from the United States, that it could never happen here. The energy and food crises in particular, will likely get bad enough that they start to ration. I assure you that one of the considerations by those in and out of the Liberal World Order is the notion of ‚Äúnever let a good crisis go to waste.‚ÄùOne of the best ways to fight medical tyranny is to take care of yourself and your family. Being healthy may not be enough to keep all the wolves at bay, but being sick is a pathway through which they can impose direct medical tyranny on you. This is why we strongly recommend purchasing Z-Stack or Z-DTox from one of our sponsors, the late Dr. Zev Zelenko, and his work‚Äôs continuation through his foundation.WokenessI used to think there was a certain mentality, whether inherent or conditioned, that made people dumb enough to fall for all the various ploys that stem from post-truth society ‚Äúlogic.‚Äù I even considered the possibility that it‚Äôs all a strong delusion, a group mental illness. Surely millions of Americans can‚Äôt think that Will ‚ÄúLia‚Äù Thomas should be competing against women, right?What I have come to realize in recent weeks is that the Mindset-Issues-Worldview paradigm is what‚Äôs really at play here. Wokeness is a trap. It‚Äôs designed to draw people into accepting one ludicrous notion. If they can get you to accept one ludicrous notion, they can get you to accept the whole mindset. Once they have you embracing a certain mindset, they can guide you toward supporting the policies they want.Supporting certain policies drives people to adopt entire worldviews based on their advocacy for the policies. This is what‚Äôs at play with rampant wokeness. Let‚Äôs look at an easy example of the Mindset-Issues-Worldview paradigm.First, they drive the mindset that ‚Äúguns kill people.‚Äù This is why they continuously refer to ‚Äúgun violence‚Äù rather than criminal activity or mental illness. They want us to think the guns are the real problem. If we do, then it‚Äôs easier to convince us that the policy answer for the issue is gun control. Like wokeness, this is a trap because once someone embraces the gun control issue, they are forced to adopt the destructive worldview that ‚Äúonly government can protect us.‚ÄùNow, let‚Äôs look at the less-obvious but equally dangerous example of one component of wokeness applied to this paradigm. If they can convince someone that the LGBTQIA+ community is persecuted, that creates a sympathetic mindset. From there, they will obviously push policy solutions that bring about LGBTQIA+ supremacy. It hasn‚Äôt been about equality for a long time, but if equality alone was not able to stop persecution in their eyes, then supremacy is the obvious answer, at least from their skewed perspective.This is a truly dangerous Mindset-Policy combination because it leads to a worldview that too few seem to understand. That worldview is anti-Biblical. If God can take someone who is supposed to be a girl and make them in a boy‚Äôs body, then the implication is obvious. Either God got it wrong or He doesn‚Äôt exist. This, more than anything else, is why they‚Äôre pushing LGBTQIA+ supremacy. This is why there are so many groomers. They want people to naturally assume that God is not real because if He is, then he got it all wrong.Economic CollapseI‚Äôm not going to spend a lot of time on this particular issue, not because it isn‚Äôt important but because it‚Äôs far too complicated for a short portion of the article. I discussed it in more detail on today‚Äôs show, but even that was not enough. I‚Äôll dive deeper into it in future articles, but there are a few things to understand upfront.First, an economic collapse may actually happen. That‚Äôs the direction this nation and western society, in general, are being pushed. It makes sense to the globalist elites. For them to ‚Äúbuild back better,‚Äù they need a foundation to be destroyed. For them to have The Great Reset, they need collapse.BlackRock, as I have said many times in the past, is not a mega-corporation that‚Äôs interested in making money. Most, even in conservative media, wrongly attribute greed as their primary driving factor. In reality, they have plenty of money and will continue to have plenty of money even if they have temporary huge losses. Their main motivation is power and pushing ESG onto as many companies as possible. That seems to be their role in the Liberal World Order. While governments, media, and activists push woke and sheepish worldviews onto individuals, BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street push the same worldview onto companies.The fact that they just had the biggest corporate loss in history should act as a reminder that I‚Äôve been right all along. They aren‚Äôt just greedy. They use other people‚Äôs greed to drive them, but the primary role of BlackRock is in exerting power over corporations. That‚Äôs it.Few in conservative or even alternative media seem to understand this, which is likely why the story below by Andrew Moran from The Epoch Times did not get more widely spread. If an America First journalist or activist thinks BlackRock is driven by greed, they would not pay too much attention to their massive losses other than to gloat and give each other high-fives. If we assume that greed is not their primary goal and that taking massive losses actually means they‚Äôre focused on accumulating power, then the story becomes much more important.Keep that in mind as you read through this (or take my word for it and skip to the bottom for my conclusions):BlackRock, World‚Äôs Largest Asset Manager, Lost $1.7 Trillion in Clients‚Äô Money This YearBlackRock, the world‚Äôs largest investment management firm with about $8.49 trillion in assets, recorded a $1.7 trillion loss in the first half of 2022, according to the company.This was the largest sum of money ever lost by a single company in a six-month span, according to Marc Rubenstein, a Bloomberg analyst.In the company‚Äôs second-quarter earnings report, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink attributed the immense loss to the collapse in the financial markets, blaming an environment of rampant price inflation, rising interest rates, and market carnage.‚ÄúThe first half of 2022 brought an investment environment that we have not seen in decades,‚Äù Fink said in a statement. ‚ÄúInvestors are simultaneously navigating high inflation, rising rates, and the worst start to the year for both stocks and bonds in half a century, with global equity and fixed-income indexes down 20% and 10%, respectively.‚ÄùRubenstein said the investment titan had also focused too much on passive investing, writing that only one-quarter of BlackRock‚Äôs assets were actively managed ‚Äúto beat a benchmark‚Äù by the end of the April-to-June period. In total, the company‚Äôs passive equity holdings are 10 times larger than its active strategy, ‚Äúalthough it does operate some active multi-asset and alternatives strategies that narrow the gap,‚Äù he noted.The earnings report also highlighted slower inflows into the New York-based firm‚Äôs core investment funds, totaling $69 billion in the three months ending on June 30. That‚Äôs $40 billion less than what analysts had forecast and a decline from the $114 billion in the previous quarter.Today, BlackRock‚Äôs largest holdings are concentrated in technology, with positions in Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla.BlackRock‚Äôs adjusted profit was $1.12 billion, or $7.36 per share, compared to the year-earlier $1.61 billion, or $10.45 per share. It also fell short of the average analyst estimate of $7.90 per share.Morningstar analysts are still long on BlackRock.‚ÄúThere was little in wide-moat-rated BlackRock‚Äôs second-quarter earnings that would alter our long-term view of the firm,‚Äù Greggory Warren, a sector strategist at Morningstar, wrote in a recent note. ‚ÄúWe are leaving our $850 per share fair value estimate in place and consider the shares to be undervalued. BlackRock continues to be our top pick among the more traditional U.S.-based asset managers we cover. The company‚Äôs shares are currently trading at a 30% discount to our fair value estimate‚Äîcompared with 20% on average for the nine firms in our coverage‚Äîand it represents a solid entry point for long-term investors.‚ÄùBlackRock Making AdjustmentsAdditionally, BlackRock confirmed that it‚Äôs tightening its belt and delaying its hiring efforts.General and administrative costs climbed by 12 percent year-over-year, driven mainly by higher expenses related to workers returning to the office, from computer equipment to health and safety investments.‚ÄúWe are mindful of the current environment, and you are proactively managing the pace of what I would call certain of our discretionary investments,‚Äù Chief Financial Officer Gary Schedlin told analysts in a call.The company also revealed that it will be exploring digital assets, despite Fink calling Bitcoin an ‚Äúindex of money laundering‚Äù in 2017. He revealed that institutional investors are still interested in that corner of the market, even though digital currency prices have cratered this year.‚ÄúThe crypto asset market has witnessed a steep downturn in valuations over recent months. But we‚Äôre still seeing more interest from institutional clients about how to efficiently access these assets,‚Äù he said.Fink told analysts that BlackRock clients are turning heavily to cash as a safe-haven asset in the current highly volatile market.‚ÄúNow an inverted yield curve has made cash not just a safe place but now also a more profitable place for investors,‚Äù he said.The 2- and 10-year yields have inverted, and the spread is about minus 25 basis points, the deepest inversion in more than two decades, according to Nancy Tengler, the CEO and Chief Investment Officer at Laffer Tengler Investments.Indeed, the Bank of America‚Äôs July survey of fund managers found that investors are parked in cash at the highest rate since 2001, while their stock allocation is the lowest since the financial crisis of 2008‚Äì09.Despite the sharp sell-off in the equities arena, Fink is confident that investors can relax a little bit.‚ÄúA really famous person called me up, panicking, ‚ÄòWhat should I do, I‚Äôve got to get out, I can‚Äôt stand it, I can‚Äôt stand it.‚Äô And I said, ‚ÄòGo on vacation,‚Äô‚Äù Fink said in an interview with CNBC‚Äôs Jim Cramer. ‚ÄúIf you really can‚Äôt stand it, then sell it. But the reality is, we‚Äôve seen this. Inflation is going to be fixed over time.‚ÄùAbout the prospect of a recession, Fink thinks that if the United States is in the middle of an economic downturn, ‚Äúit‚Äôs going to be quite mild.‚Äù‚ÄúThe financial foundation of America is as strong today as ever,‚Äù he said.BlackRock shares have tumbled by about 30 percent year to date.ConclusionsWe desperately need to start treating all of the various threats to our nation as part of a master plan. They‚Äôre keeping us divided by hitting us from multiple fronts. They push patriots in different directions just as they point their leftist underlings toward their own demise. Stay focused and keep fighting the good fight.

He went to college and university in England, and witnessed at first hand the Marxism and anti-white racial indoctrination that was undermining the country, and the cultural Marxism that dominated the universities. Returning to Bangladesh he spent many hard years running an industrial business and immersing himself in the mind and culture of the people of the Indian subcontinent. At 39 he moved to Canada, and has since lived in Vancouver. As he began to realize that Canada was not being built, but rather that a built civilization was being destroyed, he researched the slow slide and ruination of a once-proud Canada. He has stood mute witness as the green, rustic and charming Vancouver of the past was razed to build high-rises and replace green neighborhoods with slums and rabbit warrens of housing estates. As a person of East Indian ethnicity with broad exposure to both the colored and Caucasian races, minds and cultures, he is able to provide an outsider‚Äôs insight into the white mind, and show how it differs from the minds of other races. He stands for the principle that every race is unique and valuable, but he opposes the Cultural Marxist and ‚Äòliberal‚Äô tenet that the white race alone is non-existent, worthless and dispensable. That is why he has written the book Sweet Dreams and Terror Cells (https://www.amazon.com/Sweet-Dreams-T..., a work of fiction and literature, but also a sweeping overview of history, anthropology and the minds of various races. This is his first book, but it is only the opening volume of a great saga, the saga titled When Giants Break the Spell.This speech was given at the Capitalism &amp; Morality seminar in Vancouver, Canada, on Saturday, 21 July 2018. http://jayantbhandari.com/capitalism-...Frank Raymond - Implications of Mexican Migrant Inflowhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcpge...The next Capitalism &amp; Morality Seminar will take place on Saturday, 3 August 2019 in Vancouver, Canada.For more information on the seminar and links to past videos: http://jayantbhandari.com/capitalism-...Or ‚Äúlike‚Äù our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/CapitalismMo...",frank raymond implications mexican migrant inflowhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjcpgeszkplw frankraymondfrom jewtube description frank raymond born indian subcontinent spent early life calcutta darjeeling dhaka bangladesh went college university england witnessed first hand marxism antiwhite racial indoctrination undermining country cultural marxism dominated universities returning bangladesh spent many hard years running industrial business immersing mind culture people indian subcontinent moved canada since lived vancouver began realize canada built rather built civilization destroyed researched slow slide ruination onceproud canada stood mute witness green rustic charming vancouver past razed build highrises replace green neighborhoods slums rabbit warrens housing estates person east indian ethnicity broad exposure colored caucasian races minds cultures able provide outsider‚äôs insight white mind show differs minds races stands principle every race unique valuable opposes cultural marxist ‚äòliberal‚äô tenet white race alone nonexistent worthless dispensable written book sweet dreams terror cells httpswwwamazoncomsweetdreamst work fiction literature also sweeping overview history anthropology minds various races first book opening volume great saga saga titled giants break spellthis speech given capitalism amp morality seminar vancouver canada saturday july httpjayantbhandaricomcapitalismfrank raymond implications mexican migrant inflowhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjcpgethe next capitalism amp morality seminar take place saturday august vancouver canadafor information seminar links past videos httpjayantbhandaricomcapitalismor ‚äúlike‚äù facebook page httpswwwfacebookcomcapitalismmo,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
Cultural Marxism,2022-08-14,17:48:42,msonofloki,Minds,https://www.minds.com/newsfeed/1405609093422387205,"If there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned over the last 30 years‚Ä¶Is that when you didn‚Äôt see the future for something. You wound up missing out. I imagine every futurist that‚Äôs old and still alive today may feel the same way. even in the 90s when I was a teenager I didn‚Äôt see computers going anywhere. I didn‚Äôt understand them outside of the pointing and clicking.Gradually though I saw the world change around me in the preceding decades. Some things happened that they said would happen. If it was a percent or a mixture of percentages I would say it‚Äôs about 30 to 70%. 30% is what they predicted the rest being what came along over time. Instead of there being an, ‚Äúimplant for that,‚Äù the saying nowadays is, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs an app for that.‚Äù Now the reason why I didn‚Äôt even see the Internet taking off. I didn‚Äôt even get an Internet computer until I was 17. That would be 1997 if anyone‚Äôs curious.The Internet had already become a big thing in 94. It was also a technology I didn‚Äôt understand. It‚Äôs really hard catching up when you got steamrolled by everyone else‚Äôs technology. I still like to call and talk to people. As much as I hated writing and doing paperwork. I still seek to do so. My only issue with filling out forms as I don‚Äôt like doing it. I was a foreman for two months and quit. Mostly over the paperwork and that the companies I worked for would never upgrade their policies.After looking at the text sector though as well as operating policies. I‚Äôve taken a few steps back on that. The left pulls through technology. They augment lives for their own supremacy. Whatever human augmentation happens is by technocratic approval. If we use the world economic forum as a benchmark. You see where that type of augmentation becomes digital slavery. The primary reason being they want to remove the human element. Unless it‚Äôs specific humans in power. Break it down even more simply. They want to return and augment the ancient feudal system. Where the aristocracy rules over serfdom. While America may seem to be in dark times we augmented ourselves 200 years ago. Creating a nearly unbreakable system in defiance. Making our enemies find more clever means of warming their way in. They‚Äôre not very imaginative people but they are really good at using tools. Now that we have become addicted to their forms of augmentation. They believe all they have to do is push a button and write a code line. Then you‚Äôll respond to their commands. Those resistant to the program will receive a label and be shunned. The modern version of the scarlet letter.What they tend to forget is we are not found by the old way of doing things. That‚Äôs why the economic forum needs the Internet so badly. They can‚Äôt roll through words because it‚Äôs failed. The old cable systems and satellite that once was the only means of entertainment. Was unable to adapt to the network age. They wanted everyone to become more text savvy not realizing humans by nature or hackers. They also didn‚Äôt count on 90% of America being rebellious red-blooded assholes. Their words, not mine. Why can‚Äôt Americans just give up and obey? Because of the same counterculture fools that started this mess. Had kids, once millennials became adults. They found out that what they were rebelling against wasn‚Äôt so bad. Americans kind of has to do things the hard way. We celebrate rebelliousness. Which unfortunately has got us into a lot of trouble. Also, it gets us out of trouble. The constitution isn‚Äôt just a piece of paper to us. The rule of law isn‚Äôt some arbitrary mechanism of control. The left has gotten away with it for so long because Americans have become lazy. Well forcing people to work changes the dynamic. If you force someone into slavery of any kind. We will augment ourselves to free ourselves from it. The Democrats have never learned their lesson. They got their asses handed to them in the Civil War. They embrace cultural Marxism to get their slaves back. In the south not everyone had slaves. Only the ones that controlled the industry of cotton did so. The rest reports rule farmers who usually had their land taken by plantation owners. They would then be forced to work next to nothing to produce food for the plantation owners. There were two forms of slaves in the south. Poor farmers and what do you industrial workers they had. Then the slaves they bought. By the way, they weren‚Äôt all from Africa. They don‚Äôt say one thing about the Irish slaves. The Asian slaves. The Indians or Native Americans like to be called now. We‚Äôre also enslaved to work on plantations. Ever wonder why the Indians wanted to kill us?Half of the politicians broke all the treaties with the Native Americans. We‚Äôre part of the Democratic-Republicans party. They only drop the Republican party after a blinking helped found the republican party. This is all part of our history. But you can only find it if you‚Äôre looking for it. Most of these history books have not been lost. You just can‚Äôt fit it into your narrative. Public schools teach only narrative. The more stupid you are the more dependent you become.That‚Äôs why people with learning disabilities do not succeed in public school. I have three learning disabilities. While I entered the labor market and turned it into my profession. As you can read from my writings it was never really my passion. It just pays the bills. So what does this all have to do with augmentation?As I‚Äôve written in the past about hard augmentation and soft human augmentation. Is two standards that are quite flexible. I‚Äôm using an app and changing my dietary habits along with exercise. To lose the weight I put on over the years. That is an example of soft augmentation. I also use supplements to curb certain other issues that come with aging.Hard augmentation is technological, surgical, and even genetic enhancements that don‚Äôt normally come from nature. Turning an otherwise ordinary human being into something beyond that. The difference between my human augmentation and transhumanism. There‚Äôs a focus lesson on turning humans into machines. instead, my augmentations require you to stay pretty much human. Augmentations are more of an afterthought to move you beyond physical and political obstacles. A modern superhuman can‚Äôt be way down by government or nature.Living life without natural or activists created obstacles. In a pyramid structure, you‚Äôll encounter activists more than one pulling all the strings of these puppets. I would refrain from calling them parasites entirely. These useful idiots are necessary for producing a product. You‚Äôve seen the results globally.That is why the world economic forum and globalists need to control America. Americans are kind of the gold standard when it comes to individual liberties. Puppet masters cannot rule without a collective of useful idiots. Useful idiots boycott things. Be at businesses or diversity of thought. Thinking adults and productive citizens Buycott things instead. Like the examples of human augmentation, I presented above and in previous articles. Buycotts are a way of getting around business destroying morons. It‚Äôs not perfect and it‚Äôs rather slow. However, if enough people are pissed off. Whatever business council culture or individual the culture wars come after. It attracts attention to their side. Not discourages it as it does elsewhere in the world. Remember, I would consider you augmented if you defined the systems of control. You bend around an obstacle or smash through them. I don‚Äôt think the deep state understands Americans as I do. Even the most opposed people in America. Can still put aside their differences to attack a common foe. If there‚Äôs one thing I have learned about Americans we kind of wants a return on investments.Even rabid leftists are beginning to realize they‚Äôve been fucked. I try to refrain from cussing but the writing is on the wall. You see augmented humans are just the ones ahead of the curve. Tech companies are finding out you can‚Äôt just force things on people with an automated algorithm. If we don‚Äôt get what we want we will leave the platform. Safe for those staying to make themselves a thorn in the side of others. Creating alternative networks is bending around an obstacle. Being as loud as you can and refusing to be removed from a site. Is bulldozing through the narrative obstacle. If you really want to become a real Transhuman. You need not abandon the human element. You don‚Äôt need to be some genetically augmented individual. You also don‚Äôt have to be a cyborg depending on robotic parts or implants. Philosophical augmentations are not something generally written about.That‚Äôs why transhumanism will ultimately fail. They no longer see the value in human individual liberty. A transcended human has no such limitations. As much as technology is evolving it will never replace organic life forms. They‚Äôre deconstructing insect brains in all order to make smarter machines than navigate our world. A colony of ants can have pretty intelligent behavior. Because they act as supermassive organisms.Another thing about augmentations. As you may not realize you‚Äôre already augmenting it. If you own a car you are technologically augmented. By having a car of your own you are not reliant on public transportation. A car is freedom a bus is a slavery. The currency that controls you riding public transportation is productive time lost. You can‚Äôt do anything on the bus but sit on it and be bored. I‚Äôm not sure how these systems are elsewhere in the world. But in America, public transportation is near useless. This is why there are so many laws invented to take your driver's license away. Because they see it as a privilege, not a right even though in our laws it is one. That‚Äôs an ethical can of worms. But ethical concerns are outside of practicality. Is another form of slavery. It‚Äôs called morally enforced guilt. Also known as public shaming. It does have its place. But it can also be easily abused. The evidence of that is everywhere in the media. Look at the ones they praise and the ones they shame.My advice to my fellow Americans looks at the ones they hate. Then I‚Äôll let them in the office. Donald Trump is a good example of morally enforced shame. Which hunts were a social construct. As well as its means of community control. Create the bogeyman. place yourself as a moral authority and shame the witch into a confession. Trump's form of augmentation. Is he using that public shaming to his advantage? To say he‚Äôs feeding off of their hate is accurate. Another good example is Ron DeSantis. Rather than becoming the object of their hate. He just ignores them and does it anyway. Being shameless for them is armor against oppression.Everything I pointed out is a human augmentation that maintains the human element. We are all capable of this. Americans used to invent solutions to problems. It‚Äôs how we rose above everyone else in the world. It‚Äôs why America is a beacon of hope. Everyone wants to become an American. If they can‚Äôt become Americans themselves. They try taking the best of our culture as inspiration to rise above their own oppression.You see I just recently watched a series called the Sandman. One episode showed a battle between Lucifer MorningStar and the main character called a dream. I won‚Äôt spoil the scene too much. But in this contest between two celestial beings. They each took on a form that destroyed the other. The forms they took were symbolic. When the main character finally looked like he was going to be defeated. He became something that Lucifer MorningStar could not destroy. Dream defeated Lucifer's morning star by becoming hope.Even absolute darkness. The light of hope will always be there. This cannot be destroyed. Nor can you go around it. It all depends on what you hope for. Granted it‚Äôs a Netflix show. It had all the normal virtue signaling I can‚Äôt stomach. But this one actually had something useful. The idiots who produced the show may not realize it. But they gave me perfect ammunition for this post.So I guess you could say I use their stupidity against them. Find your augmentation and do not abandon your human abilities. For humanity will always find hope when all of the mechanical world is consumed by darkness.For hope can never die.Build Yourself Today a Better Future‚Ä¶#minds #futurism #Philosophy #Spirituality

Cultural Marxism,2022-07-05,0:07:47,MichaelHendrickson,Minds,,"https://theviolentthru.blogspot.com/2022/07/we-are-living-through-communist.html Recognizing that communism didn‚Äôt end with the fall of the Berlin Wall, former President Trump said in a speech, ‚Äú‚Ä¶we will fight the onslaught of radicalism, socialism, and indeed it all leads to communism once and for all.‚Äù Not only does Trump understand that communism is not dead, he perceives that this foreign and alien ideology is in control of the Democratic Party. Flying the flag on July 4th can‚Äôt turn back the clock. As we take pride in America, we have to recognize what has America become ‚Äì and what is it becoming. For that answer, read the Communist Manifesto and take note of the fact that literally dozens of communist groups operate on American soil, in open violation of the Communist Control Act, which is still on the books. (It was introduced by a Democrat, Senator Hubert Humphrey, and signed by a Republican president, Dwight Eisenhower.) The Marxists see the U.S. as a society based on slavery which has since become the leading capitalist nation and must therefore be ‚Äútransformed‚Äù into socialism on the road to communism. Hence, we currently see Marxists and their fellow travelers refer to slavery as the basis for American capitalism and the need for reparations. This is what Democrats call ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù ideology. Looking at this through Marxist eyes, the U.S. developed beyond an economic system based on slavery to be in the current stage between capitalism and socialism, what is called the highest stage of capitalism. This is when the Marxists capture the major organs of finance capital, major corporations, and the means of communication. The centralization of the means of communications in the hands of the state, a key plank of the Communist Manifesto, is being implemented in the United States under the one-party state now in power. We are literally living through a ‚Äúworld revolution,‚Äù which is why I started the publication, ‚ÄúWorld Revolution Report,‚Äù to open the eyes of Americans to our fate as a country. This fact was impressed upon me personally when, on the eve of July 4th, my anti-communist videos, some 500,were banned by YouTube, which is part of Google. They were eliminated from the platform all at once. I know other conservatives have been censored in this way, but my videos represented decades of anti-communist study and research. My channel was anti-communist from start to finish. This development, which means thousands of my subscribers no longer have access to these videos as well, further represents the consolidation of a communist dictatorship in America, with control by the Marxist elites over the key means of communication. We can debate whether the elites believe in Marxism or not. What is clear that they view Marxist strategy and tactics as political winners. The World Revolution is happening. I believe I was targeted not for videos that questioned Biden‚Äôs election as president but those about the illegitimate presidency of Barack Hussein Obama. My ‚Äúcrime‚Äù in the eyes of Big Media was challenging the legitimacy of the current one-party state, the China Joe Administration, and still raising legitimate questions about Barack Hussein Obama‚Äôs background and history. On this basis, my videos on related topics, such as Cultural Marxism, were removed. To understand our predicament, consider that Obama‚Äôs August 19, 2020, address, at the Democratic National Convention, on behalf of Biden, was the clearest indication that Obama was working for a third presidential term. He wanted to use Biden as a front for the ultimate capture of state power for revolutionary purposes. It‚Äôs Obama, not Biden, running the show. What‚Äôs interesting, according to filmmaker and researcher Joel Gilbert, is that Obama wants to replace Biden in 2024 with his wife, Michelle. It would be a clever Marxist move. Some on the Fox News Channel assure us that the cavalry is coming, meaning the Republicans will take back Congress in November. But many Fox News personalities refuse to discuss shenanigans in the 2020 presidential election and openly promote the homosexual lifestyle and movement that has led to the problem of transgenderism in schools. Fox News viewers have never been told that the founder of the gay rights movement, Harry Hay, wore dresses, got involved in the occult, and advocated for the ‚Äúrights‚Äù of the North American Man-Boy Love Association. My group got his FBI file through a Freedom of Information Act request. All major institutions of society, including the conservative establishment and the churches, are tainted by know-nothings, fakes, and fraudsters. Channels like Fox and Big Media Tech monopolies such as Google serve the state, the Biden regime, by censoring any content which casts doubt on the legitimacy of that regime. That‚Äôs how I ‚Äúviolated‚Äù YouTube‚Äôs community guidelines. But one censored video, my interview with well-known conservative author Jack Cashill, was not exclusively about the fraudulent nature of the 2020 election. We had a lengthy discussion of how Barack Hussein Obama was elected using a stolen Social Security number. YouTube does not permit discussions like this. That particular video was cited for violating YouTube‚Äôs policy against ‚Äúmisinformation.‚Äù What has changed over time, as the World Revolution continues gobbling up country after country, is that China has become the leader of the world communist movement, replacing the Soviet Union/Russia. Eventually, according to the Marxist theory of history, America will become a communist state and then be integrated into the China-dominated New World Order. However, Russia is still playing a major role, as we have seen in Europe with the invasion of Ukraine and Biden‚Äôs no-win response, dragging on for five months now. On Fox, the ‚Äúconservative‚Äù channel, one of the only independent voices, who refuses to follow the establishment Republican line, is Tucker Carlson. However, he has completely misjudged Russia‚Äôs intentions and features left-wingers such as Glenn Greenwald. Resisting censorship, conservatives must identify the communists and their fellow travelers for what they are. Calling this ‚Äúwoke capitalism‚Äù or ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù won‚Äôt suffice. And denouncing ‚ÄúMcCarthyism‚Äù only confuses people about the need for congressional internal security committees to expose and identify communists. Lt. Gen. Ion Mihai Pacepa, the highest-ranking official ever to defect from the former Soviet bloc, provided a statement for one of my conferences on the significance of the Obama presidency, saying, ‚ÄúI walked in Marxist moccasins for many years, and I can see how President Obama could have bought into the siren call of Marxism‚Ä¶‚Äù That siren call has been accepted by so many in the United States that some might say the end is near ‚Äì or fast approaching. The cavalry, if it comes, must understand the nature of the World Revolution we find ourselves in. The solution lies in the strategy of dialectical reversal, used by President Ronald Reagan when he fought the communists in Hollywood and then on the world stage. On domestic matters, this one-time former pro-abortion politician had a reversal of his own, becoming a strong pro-life advocate and commenting, ‚ÄúAbraham Lincoln recognized that we could not survive as a free land when some men could decide that others were not fit to be free and should therefore be slaves. Likewise, we cannot survive as a free nation when some men decide that others are not fit to live and should be abandoned to abortion or infanticide.‚Äù In a comment that symbolized dialectical reversal of the terms of the abortion debate, he famously remarked, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve noticed that everyone who is for abortion has‚Äãalready been born.‚Äù Legal abortion, like many of the other evils in society, originated in Soviet Russia.",httpstheviolentthrublogspotcomwearelivingthroughcommunisthtml recognizing communism didn‚äôt end fall berlin wall former president trump said speech ‚äú‚ä¶we

Cultural Marxism,2022-01-12,15:44:03,Sage,4chan,https://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/356124826,"There have always been gay people. The problem is that Communists, under the banner of ""Cultural Marxism"" (see Bill Whittle's story of the Franfurt School) are weaponizing sexuality, turning it against society. Faggotry has always been contained, and tolerated when it remained discrete. There have always been ""confirmed bachelors,"" and urban areas that catered to their needs. What we have now is the mainstreaming of child rape, in the name of LGBT ""rights."" You have toddlers being instructed in anal sex technique in California schools. You have convicted child abusers being invited into libraries to read ""gay acceptance"" propaganda to toddlers. You have ""pride parades"" that feature open displays of gay sex in some cases, and simulation of gay sex in almost all cases, combined with displays of sexual ""kink"" - people being flogged, on leashes, gagged, etc. Children are present at these, and ""progressives"" bring their children specifically to see these things, to ""educate"" them. Gay men reproduce themselves by seducing boys. Nearly all gay men were raped at a young age. The Jew/Communist/Cultural Marxist effort is to demoralize the society, to crumble the pillars of ""race, class and gender,"" so that the population has no identity as a people, envies with a bitter hatred all those who have prospered, and despises the family, especially heterosexual fathers. The economy must be destroyed, as per the Cloward Piven Strategy, in order to overwhelm the welfare state, and, in the resultant human misery, force full state Socialism. As in ""The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.""

Cultural Marxism,2022-12-05,17:47:27,abgreport,Minds,https://www.minds.com/newsfeed/1446558606777389062,"https://americafirstreport.com/bob-iger-was-brought-back-to-prolong-disneys-groomer-agenda-not-reverse-it/Conservatives cheered when former Disney CEO Bob Chapek stepped down last month. His reign at the child groomer company was pocked with an expansive push to sexualize ‚Äúkid-friendly‚Äù content and remove any semblance of family values from their programming. He also promoted the wokest agenda possible on all of their business fronts in his short time at the helm.But his replacement, former- and now current-CEO Bob Iger, is not a good guy. He‚Äôs no less groomer-minded than Chapek. He‚Äôs simply more cunning and less obvious. Parents need to understand this if they believe things are going to get better at Disney. There will be no return to the good ol‚Äô days when less culturally and political charged entertainment made Disney a safer choice for children. All he‚Äôs going to do is pull the woke agenda back into the shadows a bit.From a strategic perspective, the hope is that this will slow the financial hemorrhaging the company has been experiencing since it became far bolder with its groomer messaging under Chapek. But they have no intention of reversing course. The destruction of western society through Cultural Marxism and degradation of values is the task they‚Äôve been assigned by their globalist elite puppet masters. Their endgame is to push forward a generation of adults who were so confused through childhood that they will beg the Powers and Principalities to rule over them.Lest we forget, it was Iger who ushered in the current state of unabashed wokeness at the company. He was made CEO in 2005 after what can be characterized as a ‚Äúboard coup‚Äù against his predecessor, Michael Eisner. Since then, he oversaw the rapid transformation of the company, immediately disbanding the company‚Äôs Strategic Planning division. They were a roadblock to the woke agenda since their goals were to advance the company‚Äôs profits rather than engage in social justice warfare. That didn‚Äôt sit well with Iger, so he dumped them altogether.When the food crisis hits, they‚Äôll launch government breadlines. Proteins will run low by design, so the breadlines will be replaced by cricketlines. If you won‚Äôt be eating cricket, stock up on organic, freeze-dried chicken from Prepper Organics. Use Promo Code ‚ÄúJDR‚Äù at checkout for $50 off.Once he bought Pixar, the path forward became crystal clear. He would slowly, methodically transform the company into a grooming factory that could change the hearts and minds of children across the globe. He succeeded, which is why Chapek was brought in as a more ‚Äúrobust‚Äù version who could accelerate the agenda. He did, but it backfired. The groomer program proceeded too fast and they started losing eyeballs. Thus, Iger was brought back to slop the bleeding, but only for a short time.In essence, he‚Äôs a setup man for whoever the next mega-woke CEO will be. He‚Äôll bring the groomer agenda back to the shadows, pump out some successful projects, then hand the reins over once again for the next major indoctrination push.In many ways, this is actually a far worse scenario than the overt wokeness we saw under Chapek. Conservatives have a tendency to let their guard down after what they perceive to be victories. All it will take is a few ‚Äúnormal‚Äù projects under Iger‚Äôs rule and conservatives will cheer about how their efforts worked to change the company. But it won‚Äôt last. Moreover, the groomer agenda will not abate. It will be more subtle, and that‚Äôs actually worse than the manifest LGBTQIA+ supremacy agenda in current projects, including the disaster described below in the article by S.D. Wells. At least with blatant wokeness the alarm bells will ring. When it‚Äôs subtle, parents may willingly expose their children without even knowing the programming that is being done to them.Stay frosty, folks. We need to keep the pressure up, but more importantly we need to inform our fellow patriots that Disney is NOT going back to ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù ever. They are under the thumb of those who want to destroy us. This is one of the reasons we just launched our first Discern Media project, Discern Report. Please check it out after you read this article by S.D. Wells‚Ä¶DISNEY‚ÄôS GAY BLACK HOLE ‚Äì Where Money Goes to DisappearThe trend for Disney lately is to weave in gay scenes and themes in children‚Äôs movies and then lose a few hundred million dollars when it flops on the big screen. It‚Äôs called grooming, but it‚Äôs one nasty black hole for Disney where big bucks go to disappear.Whether it‚Äôs some drag queens in thongs twerkin‚Äô for the kids, or a gay couple shoving their tongues down each other‚Äôs throats, grooming is in ‚Äúfull swing‚Äù for children of all ages. In the new film, Strange World, the lead characters are two gender-fluid boys who are in love with each other, and the propaganda film is sinking down a dark $147,000,000 hole of losses and regrets, not counting promotional costs also sunk into it.These sexual plots woven into movies by Disney to groom America‚Äôs kids into thinking about sex, sex partners and trans-everything all the time are failing miserably. Disney has come out of the closet, but it‚Äôs not about equal rights, fair treatment or love, but rather it‚Äôs about grooming kids while the parents look on in utter disgust, unless those parents are gender-fluid drag queens in thongs also.A black hole in space is where gravity is so strong that not even light can escape it and where space time becomes deformed. In Hollywood and Disney, a black hole is where money goes into a film about sex and gender confusion in an attempt to influence children and teens to get gender-bender surgery that leaves them permanently deformed. Besides pushing gay everything on the kids, Disney loves to promote Satanic worship also, where Satan is personified as a man (film called ‚ÄúLittle Demon‚Äù) who gets teenage girls pregnant, abandons them and then comes back a decade later to steal ‚Äúhis‚Äù baby‚Äôs soul.Prepper Meds ‚Äì Stock up for now or if the supply chain crashes:‚úîÔ∏è Boost your immune system with Nutraceutical by Dr. Zev Zelenko‚úîÔ∏è Beat supply chain issues with 5 Antibiotics Delivered to Your Home‚úîÔ∏è Be ready to help yourself and your family with the World‚Äôs Best Med KitWant to lose a fortune making films? Just invest in gay and satanic themes that exploit and warp children‚Äôs mindsThere‚Äôs no quicker way to lose a few hundred million dollars, besides investing in Democrat crypto-funded election campaigns, than slinging money at a demented kid‚Äôs film for the big gay (Satan‚Äôs rainbow) silver screen. It‚Äôs the Disney gay money pit. Disney wants every scene of their movies to be a warped sub-plot that makes being gay and demonic the central themes of growing up.Part of turning America into a communist hell-hole involves big media warping the minds of future generations, starting with kids in kindergarten and nursery school. Some parents think they are supporting gay rights by taking kids to public gay strip clubs (Drag Queen Story Hour or Disney movies at the theatre), but it‚Äôs all part of a communist plot to strip children of family values, ethics, morals and religion. This turns future generations into Democrat voters who think all that matters is the extreme liberal agenda, that includes taking cancer-inducing gender-bender drugs and getting genitalia-mutilating surgery to ‚Äúswitch genders‚Äù (which isn‚Äôt even possible).Wake up and smell the dirty coffee that Disney is brewing for America‚Äôs children. It‚Äôs a pot of poison where kid‚Äôs minds get warped and investors lose hundreds of millions of dollars trying to push gay and demonic themes for feeding their own perverted agenda.If you see superheroes in Drag grooming children, take your kids and run the other direction, fast. Disney and Marvel love pumping lute into perverted, pedophiliac films that have no business (pardon the pun) being produced in the first place.terravivos.comTune your internet dial to Gender.news for

Cultural Marxism,2022-07-28,12:52:11,MichaelHendrickson,Minds,https://www.minds.com/newsfeed/1399373880002351106,"https://alt-market.us/to-take-back-our-culture-we-need-to-build-our-own-media-army/To Take Back Our Culture We Need To Build Our Own Media ArmyI have been writing about the concept of decentralization since around 2006, well before the threat of the woke takeover and the culture war became obvious. The idea is a rather simple one (most ideas that work are simple):If the corrupt system does not or will not provide what the public needs or wants then the public should provide those necessities for themselves. If they are successful then the system has two choices ‚Äì It can fade away quietly as the decentralized economy takes over, or, it can try and STOP the public from building their own production using force. If the system uses force, then it exposes its true nature as authoritarian and it encourages rebellion. One way or another, the corrupt system will be eliminated.We have already seen this with the alternative media over the past decade. When I started my first website (Neithercorp) 16 years ago, there were very few of us out there presenting the truth to the public and the mainstream media was still very much in control of the narrative. Today there is an endless array of alternative news websites and YouTube channels and the MSM is utterly dying (except maybe Fox News). Their audience numbers are crumbling while our audience numbers are rising. We are winning the news war because we offer something they don‚Äôt ‚Äì The facts.The alternative media has proven that decentralization can and does work, but there are many other areas of our culture which have not been decentralized in the slightest. Most popular media is still well under the control of people that espouse extreme cultural Marxism and globalism. Woke ideology is a communist-like movement and such movements spend a lot of time and energy seeking to disrupt the foundational culture of a nation. They do this because once the old culture is in ruins they can then introduce their own aberrant and tyrannical culture in its place. They are culture killers, and they do this deliberately because it is a methodology for gaining power.Proponents of woke ideology will claim that they have nothing to do with Marxism or communism (while openly admitting they are trained Marxists). They will claim that Marxism and communism are purely economic movements. This is a lie. All communism is predicated on cultural destruction; this is a historic FACT. We can see parallel similarities between the social justice movements of today and movements like the Cultural Revolution in Mao‚Äôs China from 1966 to 1976. Any heritage, media or religion that competes with the communist model is targeted for erasure and this is what is happening right now in America.In terms of western entertainment the methods are rather predictable ‚Äì Leftist try to avoid producing their own original content if they can. Why? Because most of them are pathetic storytellers. Why? Because narcissists don‚Äôt have imaginations. Instead, they take existing stories and hijack them as vehicles for their propaganda.They exploit an established franchise that people love and then reboot it. The reboot uses the name and nostalgia to lure in audiences. But the story and characters have no resemblance to the original mythos or lore, and audiences soon discover that their beloved characters are being murdered right in front of them. I suspect this is done with a particular element of joy, as leftists take pleasure in destruction far more than creation.They will inject as many aspects of ‚Äúcritical theory‚Äù into every product that they get their hands on. This means diversity quotas in stories where it makes no sense. They claim that every movie, TV show, comic and video game must ‚Äúreflect our modern world.‚Äù Translated that means: They think they get to determine what represents the ‚Äúmodern world.‚Äù Their movement uses minorities as a shield from criticism. If you don‚Äôt like their propaganda, then you must be ‚Äúracist.‚Äù They think they own all minorities and rage against any black or brown person that leaves the leftist plantation.They force concepts of ‚Äúequity‚Äù into every production. We already have equality of opportunity in the west, so, they had to invent a new terminology that demands equality of outcome. Equity is about special treatment and protections for any group that serves leftist interests at the time. It‚Äôs about forcing people to give up what they have worked so hard for, what they have earned through merit, and making them hand it over to the system for redistribution to the loyal soldiers of the system. You are supposed to subsidize your own enslavement.They flood all entertainment media with LGBT and gender fluidity agit-prop. The concept of the nuclear family is erased in favor of over-representation of a tiny minority of people, and some of these people never asked to be ‚Äúrepresented‚Äù by the political left anyway. Leftists don‚Äôt care. They have anointed themselves as the shepherds of all ‚Äúmarginalized‚Äù groups. If you are gay then they own you and they own your successes. You didn‚Äôt build it, they did. The vast majority of new media is overwhelmingly gay to the point that many Americans in polling actually believe that around 25% of the population is homosexual.Finally, globalism is the overarching religion of the left, and this destructive concept is making its way into many media products. The notion is that all ideals and beliefs deserve to be respected equally ‚Äì This is a lie. Not all ideals are equal, and some beliefs are psychotic. Beyond that, leftists don‚Äôt respect all ideals equally; they despise concepts like freedom, meritocracy and decentralization.There are good reasons why we don‚Äôt live in a homogenized world and we are divided into separate nations and separate tribes: Because not all tribes are equal. Some are garbage, with garbage principles and garbage leadership. I don‚Äôt want to share a tribe with the communist Chinese who commit genocide and religious intolerance and who abuse the citizenry. I don‚Äôt want to share a tribe with a Muslim nation ruled by Sharia Law that murders gay people and treats women like property. I don‚Äôt want to share a tribe with leftists who seek to undermine society and rewrite history.Globalism is the worst idea imaginable. Many tribes is a good thing, because discrimination helps humanity to separate and survive against immoral and destructive groups that seek to covertly or overtly homogenize. The last thing we need is grotesque globalist cultism invading our entertainment.So, how do we fight back?Conservatives, libertarians and liberty minded people have finally started to take the culture war more seriously, but now we need to take action to stop the saturation of leftist propaganda within our media. This means we need to produce our OWN media, including entertainment media.For decades, conservatives ignored the danger of leftists infecting pop culture, movies, television, comic books and video games. Many believed that these things were downstream from politics and that as long as we held our ground in the political arena everything would be fine. This was a huge mistake. Pop culture is not downstream from politics, both flow in tandem with each other. If you think that movies, video games and comic books are just meaningless ‚Äúnerd stuff,‚Äù then you have been duped. Younger generations are highly influenced by such content.I covered this idea briefly in a recent article on Amazon‚Äôs defilement of J.R.R. Tolkien‚Äôs Lord Of The Rings books and their upcoming travesty of a series called ‚ÄúThe Rings Of Power.‚Äù I noted that the massive negative fan reaction to Amazon‚Äôs woke plans indicated a sea change in the way Americans are viewing the entertainment they consume. They are no longer passive, and this is a good thing.They are fighting back against the propaganda implanted into these shows and movies but they also need non-woke stories to fill the void. If you don‚Äôt offer them an alternative, then they might just watch whatever is put in front of them. The brainwashing will be perpetual.Some courageous individuals and companies are taking steps to build an alternative entertainment media, but we need far more. Ben Shapiro‚Äôs Daily Wire is fighting back with their own film production company, and from what I have seen so far the movies they have made are top notch.Libertarian and YouTuber Eric July has recently launched his own comic book company and comic world called the ‚ÄúRippaverse.‚Äù The company‚Äôs first comic book release has already garnered around $3 million in purchases, which proves that yes, there is indeed a market for this type of content and people are hungry for any media which is not woke.Eric July has since been attacked relentlessly by the mainstream media (yes, over a comic book). As have I noted when it comes to decentralization, once the system attacks you, you know you are a threat to their power. They attack because they are afraid.Comedian Andrew Shulz decided to buy back his own comedy special from an unnamed streaming service because they sought to censor his anti-woke jokes. He is now offering the special (called ‚ÄúInfamous‚Äù) on his own website.We definitely need more of this. More creators taking a stand and building real alternatives to Hollywood and the woke corporate cabal. If you can‚Äôt stand leftist media and would rather watch nothing, then maybe it‚Äôs time for you to make the kind of content you would like to see?I am going to be putting my money where my mouth is very soon and releasing my own comic book campaign. I have been working on the project for around 3 months and have put together a great team. I hope to release the campaign in a couple of weeks. My feeling is that if I can tell an entertaining story, then I should. I want to continue with my economic and political analysis, but I also think it‚Äôs important to provide people with mental relief and a short escape from some of the harsher realities of our times.Leftists and woke corporations do not want you to be able to escape. They want their ideology in your face 24/7 until you give up and submit.The existing franchises that we used to take for granted when we were children are gone; they are all owned by people with dishonest intentions that hate American culture and want to see it debased into oblivion. We have to accept this fact, move on from the old stories and old content, and make our own. We have to become the new sages and storytellers of our age because no one is going to do it for us.Some people might argue that all of this is meaningless. Why worry about media and culture when we are in the middle of an economic crisis? What these folks don‚Äôt seem to grasp is that part of the reason we are in this mess is because we allowed our own cultural decline. We became apathetic in our vigilance and let mentally and ideologically unstable people take over platforms of influence. No longer. Their time is coming to an end. We are going to take it back; every piece of it, and we will do that by building a decentralized media army from the ground up.",httpsaltmarketustotakebackourcultureweneedtobuildourownmediaarmyto take

My studies are mainly criminal justice but that being essentially a subfield of sociology means I see a lot of its influence. Cultural Marxism/critical theory isn't an organized movement (though there are many organizations that promote it) but it's had pernicious effects on social sciences as it's typically applied simply to criticize the status quo in support of hypothetical, typically leftist, political ideas. 
 
 The Frankfurt School, regardless of any conspiracy theories taking it further than it was, were the principle originators of critical theory. They were essentially a bunch of communists and the stated goal of critical theory was to break down bourgeois social systems in support of building something different. This isn't to say it's an approach without merit, but those who favor it typically are hammers looking for nails regardless of the facts. 
 
 I've also never seen him decry the study of Marx in abstract as evil or wrong. The study of Marx as a positive force or as an ethically neutral actor, however, is a different story.

For it to become an ‚Äúintolerable‚Äù power, i.e. a power against which men make a revolution, it must necessarily have rendered the great mass of humanity ‚Äúpropertyless,‚Äù and produced, at the same time, the contradiction of an existing world of wealth and culture, both of which conditions presuppose a great increase in productive power, a high degree of its development. And, on the other hand, this development of productive forces (which itself implies the actual empirical existence of men in their world-historical, instead of local, being) is an absolutely necessary practical premise because without it want is merely made general, and with destitution the struggle for necessities and all the old filthy business would necessarily be reproduced; and furthermore, because only with this universal development of productive forces is a universal intercourse between men established, which produces in all nations simultaneously the phenomenon of the ‚Äúpropertyless‚Äù mass (universal competition), makes each nation dependent on the revolutions of the others, and finally has put world-historical, empirically universal individuals in place of local ones. Without this, (1) communism could only exist as a local event; (2) the forces of intercourse themselves could not have developed as universal, hence intolerable powers: they would have remained home-bred conditions surrounded by superstition; and (3) each extension of intercourse would abolish local communism. Empirically, communism is only possible as the act of the dominant peoples ‚Äúall at once‚Äù and simultaneously, which presupposes the universal development of productive forces and the world intercourse bound up with communism. Moreover, the mass of propertyless workers ‚Äì the utterly precarious position of labour ‚Äì power on a mass scale cut off from capital or from even a limited satisfaction and, therefore, no longer merely temporarily deprived of work itself as a secure source of life ‚Äì presupposes the world market through competition.

""The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e. the class which is the ruling material force of society, is at the same time its ruling intellectual force. The class which has the means of material production at its disposal, has control at the same time over the means of mental production, so that thereby, generally speaking, the ideas of those who lack the means of mental production are subject to it. The ruling ideas are nothing more than the ideal expression of the dominant material relationships, the dominant material relationships grasped as ideas; hence of the relationships which make the one class the ruling one, therefore, the ideas of its dominance. The individuals composing the ruling class possess among other things consciousness, and therefore think. Insofar, therefore, as they rule as a class and determine the extent and compass of an epoch, it is self-evident that they do this in its whole range, hence among other things rule also as thinkers, as producers of ideas, and regulate the production and distribution of the ideas of their age: thus their ideas are the ruling ideas of the epoch. For instance, in an age and in a country where royal power, aristocracy, and bourgeoisie are contending for mastery and where, therefore, mastery is shared, the doctrine of the separation of powers proves to be the dominant idea and is expressed as an ‚Äúeternal law.‚Äù""The division of labour, which we already saw above as one of the chief forces of history up till now, manifests itself also in the ruling class as the division of mental and material labour, so that inside this class one part appears as the thinkers of the class (its active, conceptive ideologists, who make the perfecting of the illusion of the class about itself their chief source of livelihood), while the others‚Äô attitude to these ideas and illusions is more passive and receptive, because they are in reality the active members of this class and have less time to make up illusions and ideas about themselves. Within this class this cleavage can even develop into a certain opposition and hostility between the two parts, which, however, in the case of a practical collision, in which the class itself is endangered, automatically comes to nothing, in which case there also vanishes the semblance that the ruling ideas were not the ideas of the ruling class and had a power distinct from the power of this class. The existence of revolutionary ideas in a particular period presupposes the existence of a revolutionary class; about the premises for the latter sufficient has already been said above.""If now in considering the course of history we detach the ideas of the ruling class from the ruling class itself and attribute to them an independent existence, if we confine ourselves to saying that these or those ideas were dominant at a given time, without bothering ourselves about the conditions of production and the producers of these ideas, if we thus ignore the individuals and world conditions which are the source of the ideas, we can say, for instance, that during the time that the aristocracy was dominant, the concepts honour, loyalty, etc. were dominant, during the dominance of the bourgeoisie the concepts freedom, equality, etc. The ruling class itself on the whole imagines this to be so. This conception of history, which is common to all historians, particularly since the eighteenth century, will necessarily come up against the phenomenon that increasingly abstract ideas hold sway, i.e. ideas which increasingly take on the form of universality. For each new class which puts itself in the place of one ruling before it, is compelled, merely in order to carry through its aim, to represent its interest as the common interest of all the members of society, that is, expressed in ideal form: it has to give its ideas the form of universality, and represent them as the only rational, universally valid ones. The class making a revolution appears from the very start, if only because it is opposed to a class, not as a class but as the representative of the whole of society; it appears as the whole mass of society confronting the one ruling class. ‚Äî""Click to expand...

WHY do they hate White people? BECAUSE we are/were Christian. It‚Äôs synonymous. There is a reason Europe became Christian, and Europeans were known simply as ‚ÄúChristians‚Äù for 1500 years. Blood and spirit are inseparable; corrupting the blood corrupts the spirit, corrupting the spirit corrupts the blood. Satan started with Eve. The Sons of God did it with the daughters of men. Esau did it with the Satanic Canaanites. Epstein did it with little White girls. Immigration and miscegenation corrupts the blood, which corrupts the spirit (our connection with God). Inversion of truth, nature, normalcy, and what‚Äôs good/Godly (cultural Marxism / cultural satanism) is the corruption of the spirit which leads us to corrupting our blood. They tried before when they opened the Gates of Toledo, and it took 800 years to drive them and their Muslim horde out. Now they‚Äôre doing it again by bringing ALL nations (people) of the world against us, and even using mRNA technology to corrupt our blood. But why us? Understand first that the Old Testament isn‚Äôt Judaism, Jews aren‚Äôt Israelites, and Jesus wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúkike on a stick‚Äù.

Putin, the gloablists, and Xi all want to expand their influence so they can lord over the peasants (that's us).There's a lot of Putin support because he's not the one trying to give hormones to your children and banning you from society if you don't take a vaccine (although if you lived in Russia, he'd gladly conscript your children to war, or have you disappear if you were a problem). His intelligence services do encourage cultural marxism here because it weakens the west. So does China.In addition to the huge astroturfing of Ukrainian support, it's also natural for people to support Ukraine here because everyone loves an underdog, and they have been fighting as well as could be expected.What we need to do first is avoid entering this war. I don't care if Ukraine falls. Europe can wake up and defend themselves. Russia intends to eventually absorb Finland and replace America as the dominant influence in Europe, mostly through diplomatic and economic means. They want a Russia-friendly Europe led by Germany and France. This is all laid out by Alexander Dugin, a moscow strategist with a heavy amount of influence.The problem is that you have people here who think life is like a Marvel movie so they think Globalist bad = Putin good. Which means if you dare suggest facts about what is going on, such as the fact that Putin got smoked in the first couple days of this war (doesn't really matter, he will take it anyway, but it is interesting to watch and learn from what has gone on - but you can't do that here), you get called a pedophile globo whatever by people who can't process anything more complicated than the binary ""Globo bad Putin good"". The same thing is true everywhere else, people think ""Putin bad Ukraine good"". Neither of those are true.The three big problems here areWe need to avoid war, especially nuclear war.

Cultural Marxism,2022-11-05,8:42:38,unavailable,Telegram,https://t.me/martinezperspective/26272,"The point of this post was very simple: People should not blame the old order for the actions of those who overthrew it. As usual, the ""Third Positionists"" totally missed the point. These self-identified Socialists have spent the last few years claiming (without any empirical evidence) that Cultural Marxism does not exist and that we instead live under ""Cultural (Classical) Liberalism"" or ""Cultural Capitalism."" ""Leftists and non-Whites are not demolishing the West and peddling Globalism, it's those dang Anglo-American Liberal Free Market Capitalists!"" Before WW2 (or at least until around the Great Depression, when Socialists gained more influence), the ideology of the Anglosphere was unabashed White (Anglo-Saxon) supremacism, eugenics, scientific racism, segregation, anti-immigration and nativism, Christianity, strong families, and traditional culture. You'd have to be completely insane to believe that the system we live under today is remotely comparable in terms of economics or ideology. We have more regulations than ever before, big government-backed monopolies, private-public partnerships, bloated welfare states, massive taxes, massive global wealth redistribution from Whites to non-Whites, and Socialist (or ""Social Democratic"") parties dominating governments since the end of WW2. Even the so-called ""Capitalist"" elites of the WEF & Co. express their desire to abolish Capitalism. Furthermore, all of the theory that underpins so-called ""Cultural Liberalism"" was cooked up by Marxist academics and their students, not the corporate boardrooms of Fortune 500 companies. Noel Ignatiev, Franz Boas, Theo Adorno, Herbert Marcuse, Kim Crenshaw, Angela Davis, etc. are Socialist Third Worldists, not Classical Liberals. Plus, as I've repeatedly pointed out, postwar Globalist ideology has deep roots in the Socialist movement, dating back to the earliest Utopians and Radicals (I'll write an article on this topic soon). Modern ""Capitalists"" (corporations, businesses, etc.) parrot Cultural Marxist (""Woke"") ideals for a few reasons: 1. They're forced to do so by Civil Rights laws (enacted by Socialists & Social Democrat governments in the 60s/70s). 2. They're threatened by ""cancel culture"" enforced by Leftist media hegemony and NGOs like the ADL. 3. Leftist activists aggressively colonized corporations as part of their Long March Through The Institutions of Power. 4. Globalist elites (who take ideological cues from Leftist academia and from being predominantly ethnically Jewish) have bought up and monopolized corporations. 5. Too Big to Fail companies can push unprofitable ideological nonsense because they're supported by the state. 6. Companies are kept in line by private finance pressure, e.g. BlackRock's ESG which is a corporate Cultural Marxist social credit score. Corporations aren't special unique entities controlled by magical abstract economic wizardry, but nodes of power (like government, media, academia, or judiciary) that can be captured or dominated by ideologically-motivated parties and individuals. Finally, if Anglo-Saxon Classical Liberalism inevitably leads to Globalism and transgender toddlers due to some inherent ""structural flaw,"" then what does that imply for imperial monarchist countries, like Germany, Russia, and China? They succumbed to Leftism faster than any Anglo-Saxon state. Spain was a Fascist/monarchist country up until the late 70s but is now as Globalist as they come. Socialist ""Third Positionists"" want you to blame ""Anglo-American Liberal Capitalists"" for all of our woes because, in typical Leftist fashion, they are trying to sell a poison (Socialist Third Worldism) as its own antidote. They want the technocracy, the UBI, the bloated welfare state, to save all of the ""oppressed"" brown people around the world, and so on. This is why they downplayed or defended the COVID tyranny, claimed that Agenda 21 is irrelevant, tried to rehabilitate Socialist states (e.g. Yugoslavia), and idolize countries like Russia and China, both of which are anti-White, multiethnic/racial technocracies.",point post simple people blame old order actions overthrew usual third positionists totally missed point selfidentified socialists spent last years claiming without empirical evidence cultural marxism exist instead live cultural classical liberalism cultural capitalism leftists nonwhites demolishing west peddling globalism dang angloamerican liberal free market capitalists ww least around great depression socialists gained influence ideology anglosphere unabashed white anglosaxon supremacism eugenics scientific racism segregation antiimmigration nativism christianity strong families traditional culture youd completely insane believe system live today remotely comparable terms economics ideology regulations ever big governmentbacked monopolies privatepublic partnerships bloated welfare states massive taxes massive global wealth redistribution whites nonwhites socialist social democratic parties dominating governments since end ww even socalled capitalist elites wef co express desire abolish capitalism furthermore theory underpins socalled cultural liberalism cooked marxist academics students corporate boardrooms fortune companies noel ignatiev franz boas theo adorno herbert marcuse kim crenshaw angela davis etc socialist third worldists classical liberals plus ive repeatedly pointed postwar globalist ideology deep roots socialist movement dating back earliest utopians radicals ill write article topic soon modern capitalists corporations businesses etc parrot cultural marxist woke ideals reasons theyre forced civil rights laws enacted socialists social democrat governments ss theyre threatened cancel culture enforced leftist media hegemony ngos like adl leftist activists aggressively colonized corporations part long march institutions power globalist elites take ideological cues leftist academia predominantly ethnically jewish bought monopolized corporations big fail companies push unprofitable ideological nonsense theyre supported state companies kept line private finance pressure eg blackrocks esg corporate cultural marxist social credit score corporations arent special unique entities controlled magical abstract economic wizardry nodes power like government media academia judiciary captured dominated ideologicallymotivated parties individuals finally anglosaxon classical liberalism inevitably leads globalism transgender toddlers due inherent structural flaw imply imperial monarchist countries like germany russia china succumbed leftism faster anglosaxon state spain fascistmonarchist country late globalist come socialist third positionists want blame angloamerican liberal capitalists woes typical leftist fashion trying sell poison socialist third worldism antidote want technocracy ubi bloated welfare state save oppressed brown people around world downplayed defended covid tyranny claimed agenda irrelevant tried rehabilitate socialist states eg yugoslavia idolize countries like russia china antiwhite multiethnicracial technocracies,2,0,1,5,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

 overall though, it's very apparent that god has taken offense with comicsgate's sins of 2021, its failure to honor its compact with backers as well as idolatrous behavior like the embrace of that star wars girl calendar, and he has saw fit to afflict them with a series of terrible curses like the return of mitch breitweiser, another narzack vehicle and follow up what frog termed ""the year of fulfillment"" (in which very little was fulfilled) by ushering in what is already being referred to as the year of forgiveness (where none shall be spared).
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2022/01/09 - talking & drawing with shane davis - debate! shane & yanzi vs nerdette & guest
 
 appropriate for the beginning of 2022, the year of forgiveness, this highly anticipated, unmoderated debate between nerdette and shane davis & wife went down a few hours ago. nerdette's comicsgate apostasy has been noted in previous posts and she has been loudly challenging anyone to debate her on the merits of the anti-sjw youtuber scene, leveling accusations of them being grifters who survive by generating negativity and toxicity towards otherwise totally acceptable fandoms. her challenges to debate have not gone unanswered, first by eric july and now by shane davis.
 
 shane davis, perhaps mindful of frog's outspoken concerns regarding his well known verbal incontinence in a debate setting, insisted on his wife/primary wrangler yanzi lee being allowed as a co-debater, a move that nerdette taunted beforehand a show of cowardice and lack of confidence on shane's part. to even things out, nerdette was allowed a teammate of her choice in this 2 v 2 debate. disappointingly, nerdette was unable to secure the obvious pick - forced adversity - as the two had a falling out a few weeks ago when he made a callout video against another pop culture commentator as a ""grifter"", nerdette objected to this smearing of a friend in the comments of the video, to which forced adversity responded called her a piece of shit outrage grifting race baiter, blocked her and then nuked his own comment section for optics-related reasons. having somehow burned his bridges from both the comics sjw and anti-anti-sjw youtube scenes, forced adversity went on to declare ""victory over comicsgate"" the following week and announce the beginning of a new channel that consists of drama commentary/stirring shit in the ongoing breadtuber civil war where destiny and vaush's supporters are awash in mutual pedophilia accusations.
 
 while denied forced adversity's adored antics like the almost certain taunting shane davis with names like ""bitchass cuck"" and doubtless racist taunts towards his wife in the name of liberal wokeness, there was a wide roster of characters like blerd without fear, saggy melonz or amit raina willing to go on and ""debate"" the starlight cats creative team. tragically nerdette chose none of them, electing instead to invite her morning show host, comic shop owner and consoom-tuber comic boom, aka rocky, an inoffensive and level-headed pick but overall very uninvested in the topic at hand.
 
 the debate opens with some genialitiies and preamble by shane davis (the impromptu host in the absence of a moderator) along with some banter to warm up the crowd. this goes on for over four minutes as it's clear that both he and nerdette aren't particularly eager to start this showdown, circling each other with small talk until it falls upon the most aggressive person on the panel - yanzi - to force the debate forward by addressing the topic of dylng sales in the mainstream.
 
 shane seizes the opportunity to speak first and begins a long, unformed diatribe about his experiences within the mainstream industry and the influence of market forces and editorial fiat on the comic book form, shifts in format such as the drive towards digital and collected material and so on - this all builds towards his statement that ""in his opinion"", comic sales are down.
 
 while arguing from a position of opinion kind of sucks, the first to reply to shane's argument (using the term vey loosely) is comic boom, who agrees with shane's opinion that, from what he sees in his local comic shop, comic sales are down. but comichron's figures are an objective metric that trump his personal opinions. helpfully, at 7 minutes in rocky follows this by citing comichron statistics that genres like manga, ya and independent comics are booming while western superhero comics are sinking fast and generally blowing the fuck out of his team's entire position before nerdette even has a chance to speak. shane reacts to this by shifting in his chair uncomfortably, his mind no doubt busy conjuring some anecdote tying together a time he was gathering mushrooms in the woods as child to his job interview with dan didio while yanzi has a frozen expression of disbelief at what she's seeing here.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 next is yanzi, who cites comichron statistics confirming comic boom's experiences that comic book stores are in decline. shane uses this opportunity to define the scope of the debate by defining the ""comics"" in decline as 'conventional western superhero comics by mainstream publishers like marvel, dc, image, boom, etc.' essentially what comic boom already conceded, following this by ruminating for five unbroken minutes on the reasons he interprets as indicative of direct market sales being in decline as well as the the causes he believes behind this decline such as relaunches and event fatigue.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 nerdette, perhaps sensing that going against an inveterate dissembler like shane davis in his field of expertise in a debate with no stipulated moderator and no interruptions was a mistake, scrambles and starts interjecting to get an opening statement 15 minutes into the debate. shane visibly bristles at this breaking of the agreed upon rules, resigning himself to interrupting nerdette at every opportunity, nerdette pulls up her own evidence from comichron, as well as a screencap of one my posts about shane davis. she settles on this chart by comichron indicating record profits from marvel, dc and image right up to 2015.
 
 shane challenges the validity of the chart by arguing that these revenue figures were calculated on the basis of batman being fixed at 100,000 sales, something that is no longer necessarily true these days and that in truth nobody really has accurate sales figures from these comic companies. comichron's revenue statistics, argues shane, are at best an estimate based on conjecture. nerdette demands proof of this debunking of her chart, which shane is uninterested in providing. again, ""helpfully"", nerdette's debate partner rocky, no stranger to comichron himself as a lifelong comic shop owner, interrupts to back shane up on comichron's sales calculations and shut down nerdette completely. shane uses this to go on a long-form discussion for the next ten minutes on how floppies are used as an indicator for what is optioned for a graphic novel/trade paperback print run and the decline of floppies can be extrapolated as the decline of western direct market comics as a whole, as opposed to interpreting the statistics as simply western comic customers opting for trades over floppies.
 
 
 
 yanzi follows up with this chart from npd bookscan courtesy of forbes, setting off a 40 minute discussion on the success of manga, some footage shane and davis took of the diminishing presence of non-manga comics in their local chain bookstore and the reasons for manga's marketplace superiority over comics, including diversity of genre and prioritizing of quality storytelling. these words began to stir nerdette's audience, gathered when she was pro-comicsgate, and they started joining in on ranting about sjws this and cultural marxism that. ""hey yeah, comics are being ruined!"" nerdette herself however remained unpersuaded.

 nerdette went on cite a statistic of more periodical titles being launched as proof of industry growth, to which yanzi pointed again at the chart indicating the decline of total units sold for periodicals, declaring that ""i'm just going to keep bringing up these two charts until it sinks in"". shane says he's no longer interested in further discussion on this subject and would like if it they moved on to a different topic, after a recess for superchat readings.

 next was the topic of dc and marvel making all their properties gay.. for his part, comic boom rambled for three minutes complaining about how jon kent being gay stymied some fan pairing he had of jon kent and saturn girl by bendis, but because he's bisextual it could still happen so his displeasure with the decision to make radical changes to superman as an ip. okay. it's at this point that shane, sensing victory, starts to clown around, playing with his soundboard and wheeling ""dc are the real racists"" arguments as a form of livestreamed shitposting, leaving yanzi to perform her all-important role as shanewrangler and getting the debate on the tracks
 
 and so it does, with the next topic of debate on superman being raped. comic boom harkens back to a previous, similar debacle in comics past around 20 years ago when mark waid got his fanfic girlfriend devin grayson a job writing her husbando nightwing/dick grayson, who then promptly wrote a story where he got raped by a self-insert villain of grayson's creation, thus providing an abject lesson on the perils of hiring either girlfriends or fanfic writers. in a recent interview, relayed by rocky, grayson reflected on how this expression of her non-consensual fangirl passion left a permanent stain on her career (and possibly other things); the lesson rocky takes from this is that you shouldn't rape iconic characters, which i find to be a fairly moderate position.
 
 shane davis expounds on this by giving an impassioned speech on the weight of legacy that he felt when encountering fans of iconic characters and, having witnessed this, felt a deep desire not to make what he wanted, but something that was true to the character's millions of lifelong fans. nerdette agrees, rape is bad - but it ultimately doesn't matter because this was an ""elseworlds"" story and that as non-canonical, all the outrage over the story was ultimately inconsequential. shane argues that she asks shane davis how he can say the same when he raped red lantern bleez (which is to say, the backstory of the fictional character's rage-fueled powers are based on traumatic rape). shane is, perhaps understandably, offended at himself being described as raping anything, which sends nerdette for a backpedal and some rephrasing. he then adds that while he created the character, he did not write the story and invites her to take it up with the writer of the story (geoff johns).
 
 finally, the last subject of the evening is broached - mainstream comics and the phenomenon of tokenization; the race-swapping, gender swapping and ""diversification"" of established characters and properties. comic boom at this point is starting to crack at this point, ranting about how much he truly hated dc""s cynical editorial decision to take jon kent from a wholesome 6 year old going on adventures and then speed-aged and mutilated the character into something unrecognizeable just to make some faggy ya romance so dc and tom taylor can get on a mainstream media news cycle for a couple days.
 
 nerdette's argument is that deliberate appeals to as many demographics as possible is ""capitalism"" in action and that the core of shane's objections stem from issues he's having with the capitalist process in action, which she finds curious for an self-described conservative. yanzi tosses out some baldfaced race baiting in response, asking if nerdette is fine with corporations shamelessly pandering to minorities in a shameless attempt to separate them from their money with substandard and derivative clones of white character and white stories (paraphrasing). nerdette argues that what shane is describing is an inevitable consequence of capitalist system and that objecting to it is an effectively anti-capitalist stance; her feelings for and against the practice are immaterial.
 
 shane muddles through an explanation that while dc's beancounters are looking at these characters through a corporate, purely sterile lens as essentially brands and intellectual property while what gives these characters value are the stories and character, and when they race and gender swap the character like clay until there's a superman tailored for every possible identity group it annihilates the one thing of any true value to a reading customer. nerdette dismisses this as shane having an issue with capitalism.
 
 
 
 
 
 the davis family decides to ratchet up the outrage on behalf of asian people to the next level, deciding that to own the sjw, they must become the sjw and post an article from dc comics' blog celebrating ""asian pacific heritage month"" (here). shane boldly compares the above with dc comics celebrating black history month by inviting the reader to grab some malt liquor and ride up to a bucket of fried chicken and presses their opponents hard on that if they don't side with comicsgate against dc comics, they are the ones who are racists. comic boom! panics immediately, vomiting out a word salad and trembling begging yanzi forgiveness in that he didn't recognize the racism right away.
 
 
 
 
 
 smiller also showed up in nerdette's chat, taking a breaking from counting his smillions to troll and post shit like ""yum yum me love dim sum"" as his contribution to this very important and gripping race issue raised by shane, as well as lend moral support i guess.
 
 at this point the debate is more or less over, with nerdette seething in her own chat while shane and yanzi mercilessly wield dc's pandering to asians with crude pr stunts like chinese superman as a cudgel to beat their opponents into submission with one hand and using yanzi's race as a shield from any criticism with the other. it could end here but it stretches on for 40 more minutes because of the lack of any moderation; only coming to a stop when shane davis got bored of genial, friendly conversation with comics boom!, aka rocky. rocky shows shane his hardcover collection of his work and confesses that he is a diehard fan of his work. nerdette left the stream, leaving the clear victors to start playing ads for inglorious rex and start shilling on her channel. i didn't know this was an actual rule but whatever. nerdette then went on to private the stream on her end as soon as it ended, leaving this postscript of the whole affair:
 
 
 
 
 
 conclusion: what lessons can we take from this first thrilling episode of comicsgate: the year of forgiveness? i suppose the first one would be not get a debate partner who concedes 90% of your opponent's arguments before you can get an opening statement in. also the alinsky credo of never being afraid to use one's enemy's morals against them proved true once again. if comicsgate has taugh

Feminism, CRT, cultural Marxism: all the same shit - traditional way is bad bad so bad. A whole new language has arisen to support this. Words like Racist, Misogynist, Homophobe and the like have arisen to demonize ideas which predate the wheel. Ideas likepeople prefer the company of their own kindmen and women are differentgay people can undermine social cohesionwere understood for 100,000 years and practiced by every society until critical theory.So when you investigate that, you see that the modern left is in fact Semitic in origin, both philosophically (uniting the ideas of Freud and Marx is the essence of critical theory) and practically: Weil and Horkheimer, and later Alinsky, Steinem, Friedan, Julius Rosenwald, Soros etc. The leaders of the left have always been Jews. Politically, the loudest cheerleaders for the left are often Jews: Sanders, Schumer and in the past, Mr. Immigration himself, Jacob Javits. One need only look at the impeachment(s) of POTUS Trump to see how Jews feel about MAGA. In addition to Schumer, the leaders included Schiff, Nadler and Raskin....and of course Vindman. FYI Raskin's wife is a far left activist (Surprise!) that Sen Manchin is keeping away from the Fed.We see then that:the left is based on critical theory, which is revealed by its name: a critique of traditional social structures. (The Frankfurt school was a social theory school)The creators of this. philosophy and its leaders thereafter are mostly jews, certainly Jews are disproprotionally represented. This tracks with data showing Jews vote 8/10 (D).The only uncertainty is Rep Greene's opinions, which we can't be sure of.

COMMUNIST JEWS - POLITICAL INSIGHTS ORGANIZED JEWRY: DESTROYERS OF THE WESTERN CIVILIZATION ‚Äì Marcus Eli Ravage, Jewish author, quote from January 1928 issue of Century Magazine ‚ÄúWe Jews, we, the destroyers, will remain the destroyers for ever. Nothing that you will do will meet our needs and demands. We will for ever destroy because we need a world of our own, a God-world, which it is not in your nature to build.‚Äù ‚Äì Maurice Samuels, Jewish author, quote from You Gentiles. For centuries, organized Jewry has been at the forefront in the efforts to subvert, corrupt, and eventually destroy traditional Western civilization and all that it stands for. Henry Makow, in a review of E. Michael Jones‚Äô The Jewish Revolutionary Spirit and Its Impact on World History, described the role played by organized Jewry to accomplish this goal as ‚Äúsubversive in the profoundest sense, overturning the Will of God, ‚ÄúLogos,‚Äù Christ‚Äôs Gospel of Love, the inherent Design and Purpose of Creation, hijacking mankind and arresting its development according to Cabalistic and Talmudic dictates.‚Äù Through their control of the media and Hollywood, their influence in popular culture and the arts, various intellectual and ‚Äúsocial justice‚Äù movements including cultural Marxism, feminism, and radical homosexuality, the promotion of pornography and sexual degeneracy, and advocacy of mass immigration and ‚Äúmulticulturalism‚Äù in Western European and European-derived countries (the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand), organized Jewry has certainly targeted tradition Western civilization for destruction. These destabilization techniques represent a Jewish plot to culturally, spiritually, politically, and economically corrupt, pollute, and destroy European culture primarily, and all decent, honorable indigenous cultures generally. Organized international Jewry must be viewed as a hostile elite determined to destroy Western civilization. In the Preface of Culture of Critique, Dr. Kevin MacDonald breaks this down quite well: CofC describes how Jewish intellectuals initiated and advanced a number of important intellectual and political movements during the 20th century. I argue that these movements are attempts to alter Western societies in a manner that would neutralize or end anti-Semitism and enhance the prospects for Jewish group continuity either in an overt or in a semi-cryptic manner. Several of these Jewish movements (e.g., the shift in immigration policy favoring non-European peoples) have attempted to weaken the power of their perceived competitors ‚Äî the European peoples who early in the 20th century had assumed a dominant position not only in their traditional homelands in Europe, but also in the United States, Canada, and Australia. At a theoretical level, these movements are viewed as the outcome of conflicts of interest between Jews and non-Jews in the construction of culture and in various public policy issues. Ultimately, these movements are viewed as the expression of a group evolutionary strategy by Jews in their competition for social, political and cultural dominance with non-Jews. Since the 1960s a hostile, adversary elite has emerged to dominate intellectual and political debate. It is an elite that almost instinctively loathes the traditional institutions of European-American culture: its religion, its customs, its manners, and its sexual attitudes. ues that Western civilization has essentially become Judaized, as the revolutionary Jewish intellectual and cultural leaders, including Theodore Adorno, Siegfried Freud, and others, and their ideas have been ‚Äúavidly embraced by the vast majority of non-Jewish intellectuals‚Äù which demonstrates how ‚Äúthe Western intellectual world has become Judaized ‚Äî that Jewish attitudes and interests, Jewish likes and dislikes, now constitute the culture of the West, internalized by Jews and non-Jews alike.‚Äù Dr. MacDonald continues: admin ...

Cultural Marxism,2022-02-24,13:08:45,OnlyCaleb,Patriots,https://patriots.win/p/141rsncpV3/trump-called-in-to-the-laura-ing/c/,"Thank you Bob, and totally agree. I'm a millenial as I'm 29 and I despise millenials.If we want to go by generational stereotypes, millenials are lazy, leftist, hipsters, who drink soy lattes and cancel people over twitter., Gen Z is super homosexual and transgender, etc.I'll take a boomer over my generation or gen z any day of the week. When they point out what ""boomers"" did in the 60s, they're basically talking about what hippies did, which 1) hippies were young at the time and young people are always idiots, but they were also a subset of that generation, not representative of all the boomers at the time and 2) that was a symptom of a culture that started to abandon God around that time, not the problem...the hippie marxist stuff was a symptom of us turning away from God.I really believe the whole boomer thing was a psy-op to get us to do what the left does, pointing the finger at a convenient target (in their case white people, in our case boomers)I remember when the boomer thing started and it's like it came out of thin air. The culture war was really starting to be won by Patriots, the tides were turning and most importantly, we were focused on the task, focused on the target (the cultural marxism everywhere)...and then suddenly, everyone started repeating ""ok boomer"" out of nowhere, and both the left and the right were doing it and our focus was diverted.When both the left and the right rally around a cultural talking point, you can be pretty sure you're being played.Take Pepe, the left hate pepe and call it a symbol of racism and whatnot, and pepe has been very effective for us, which is one way you know it's legitimate.Comparing that to the Karen memes which both the right and left use, there's a reason the left is ok with and just as frequently uses the ""Karen"" memes because it's a way to demonize suburban white women exclusively, when if a black woman behaved in the same way she's not called a Karen.Same with ""ok boomer"" the left is ok with it because it diverts the problem, gets people to look at a boogeyman rather than take personal responsibility.The left hates personal responsibility which is why they join hands with any meme that gets the right to create a boogeyman like the ""black community"" does. Because boogeymen destroy the movements/cultures that try and chase after them because those movements/cultures never end up cleaning up their own crap and instead focus on chasing that ever elusive and vague ""bad guy"". It's always ""the mans"" fault...but you can't ever fix ""the man"" but you can fix yourself.Even if boomers were the source of every problem we face (they're not, but just in a hypothetical), you could never do anything about that. The 60s are long gone, and it's like the black people forever obsessing about slavery. Neither black people nor us own a time machine so obsessing about a past event will only destroy you, rather than get you to fix yourself.",thank bob totally agree im millenial im despise millenialsif want go generational stereotypes millenials lazy leftist hipsters drink soy lattes cancel people twitter gen z super homosexual transgender etcill take boomer generation gen z day week point boomers theyre basically talking hippies hippies young time young people always idiots also subset generation representative boomers time symptom culture started abandon god around time problemthe hippie marxist stuff symptom us turning away godi really believe whole boomer thing psyop get us left pointing finger convenient target case white people case boomersi remember boomer thing started like came thin air culture war really starting patriots tides turning importantly focused task focused target cultural marxism everywhereand suddenly everyone started repeating ok boomer nowhere left right focus divertedwhen left right rally around cultural talking point pretty sure youre playedtake pepe left hate pepe call symbol racism whatnot pepe effective us one way know legitimatecomparing karen memes right left use theres reason left ok frequently uses karen memes way demonize suburban white women exclusively black woman behaved way shes called karensame ok boomer left ok diverts problem gets people look boogeyman rather take personal responsibilitythe left hates personal responsibility join hands meme gets right create boogeyman like black community boogeymen destroy movementscultures try chase movementscultures never end cleaning crap instead focus chasing ever elusive vague bad guy always mans faultbut cant ever fix man fix yourselfeven boomers source every problem face theyre hypothetical could never anything long gone like black people forever obsessing slavery neither black people us time machine obsessing past event destroy rather get fix,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Cultural Marxism,2021-12-19,17:53:37,obsidian8,Minds,,"Jewish infection Environment of the social nature is mainly formed by genetics and the external reality is the interal reality. There is an interplay of forces outer forces with inner forces that do affect genetic behaviour and codes epigenetics shows. But this bring us back to nature. Where the liberal tabula rasa debate picks up from the xian disease. And thinks man exists outside of natural forces and reality. The false divide is in there thinking. Its needed to manifest the belief system of universal oneness and other racial and generally egalitarian delusions the enemy psychological warfare programs are based in. Fact is people have been deeply saturated in jewish communist propaganda under the tinsel of false spirituality [xianity] and in its secular form [liberalism, cultural marxism, communism] and with centuries of this the jew system still has to try and force the races to mix as much as possible and yet people of all races still retain their intrinsic desire to not commit miscegenation and have thier own space. I remember sitting in a large dinner hall in liberal land and watched all the different races sit with their own at the individual tables and within that the guys with the guys and girls with the girls. All these people parrot the cultural marxist/liberal paltitudes but blood is thicker then water. And reality will not be denied. That dinner hall was a real map of reality. This ideology of liberalism, cultural marxism and communism [the secular xian trinity of jew]. Has failed all over the Western world and all throught history causing wars, conflicts, balkandization of nations. Giving us conflicts and slaughter. Such as the slaughter in Rawanda and across Africa which was generated by the period of European [Rothschild] rule of Africa. They herded all the different African ethnicities into large new nations. When the Western governments pulled out [jews stayed behind as the corperations/banks] the different ethnicities started to war on against one another till new tribal lines where drawn. This failure cost millions of lives. An interesting case of dual failure of both the multicult[ethnic/racial] program along with communism is evidenced in the Khmer reigme of ‚Äúdemocratic Kampuchea.‚Äù The reds slaughtered entire classes and populations, even breaking up the family unit, and wiping away an entire culture and social order in accordence with the communist ideology dictates. Turning the entire nation into a backward police state that would make Orwell blush. All in the name of brotherhood, equality, peace, unity and love. But there is a subtle context within the exterminations and repressions of the Khmers mission to create the perfect communist society. [Mass suicide of a people due to judeo-communist psychosis.] Khmer exterminations which where done within the lines of communist ideology but within a ethinc conflict as well. The decades of animus over the ethinc Vietnamese population in Cambodia [kampuchea] the majority of those sent to S21 [where the mount of skulls images are mainly from] where Vietnamese in ethinc background. The Khmer Rouge worked towards the literal goal of the total extermination of the entire Vietnamese and other non Cambodian populations in their country. Cambodian men married to non-Cambodian women where given pistols by the Khmer‚Äôs and told to kill their wives or the Khmers‚Äôs would kill them both. Here we see the failure of the multi-ethnic nation [liberal world dream] and what happens when its naturallly generated hosity is given chance to be fully aired. And the reality of communist ideology all coming together. Of which liberalism is the centeral core. Before the left where slaughtering in the name of the communist ideology they where chopping heads and exterminating populations in the name of liberalism [of which Marx simple took and built an updated version of to suit the industrial era] as seen in the ‚ÄúFrench‚Äù revolution. Before the Bolsheviks we had the Jacobins. Pol Pot [not his real name] was converted to this [communism/liberalism a religion] in the universities and salon‚Äôs of Paris where he was a student for years. He returned to Cambodia with his red priest collar awarded for success at the liberal-red seminary training in Paris. And worked to fully implement the creation of the city of communism on earth. A regular red Augustine. Western noted communist intellectual and scholars openly and proudly admitted [where their more timid brethen ran for the hills in a wave of apologetics] that Pol Pot and the Khmer‚Äôs where the full implementation of the pure ideal of communism on a nation. Another instance of this is Tito‚Äôs communist Yugoslavia. After he died and the nation he forced together under the same leftist nonsense pushed by the liberals, cultural marxists kooks and ilk in the West. Broke apart into a long violent war full of ethnic cleansing and all kinds of atrocities. Till the ethnic bounds and lines where rebuilt. The Western liberal-red would state the problem is implementation of the ideology and the not the ideology. So they continue to push harder making the problems worse never understanding they are the cause not the solution. Because that is how mentally ill people think. This is how xianityoperates as well. They are all confused and mentally ill people. As one German philospher stated: ‚ÄúChristian theology is the grandmother of Bolshevism.‚Äù In India which is the liberal anti-racialist world dream all raced mixed. Most dating adds state ‚Äúlight skinned only‚Äù and people are graded and prized on their level of lightness. And group based genetic inheritance. Just look at the Bollywood starts to understand what the ideal of beauty is there. And all sorts of general ethnic conflicts dominate. India was also under a marxist, secular government after independence which just ruined their nation for decades. Once again the ideology is a failure on every level. But schizoid liberals, cultural marxists, xians and other sundry nutted fruits of the jewed plains can‚Äôt form a intelligent understanding of the nature of reality we are all formed from and a manifestation of. And hence the laws that manifest us are the laws that govern us. They dysfunctional brains can only be at home in a violent dystopia. Because a lunatic feels at home in a sea of lunatic‚Äôs and lunacy only. So we see nature will not be fooled and that which is unhealthy and against the laws of nature will consume itself in its own toxic poisons. Just at the society in live in outside of racial, ethnic tensions. [Which have consumed Western society and created a violent situation where tens of thouands have been victims many raped, beaten and murdered whole areas are no go zones] The rates of mental illness are throught the roof and growing. People commit suicide in large numbers, depression and apathy are normal. The jails are over populated in the millions. Drugs are destroying whole communities. People are dying of all kinds of physical illness rates that have skyrocketted. Our nations, societies and civilizations are crumbling due to a jewish induced and injected spiritual sickness. To paraphase one wise person: Governments destroy freedom, schools destroy knowledge, religion destroys sprituality, psycharists destroy mental health, medical professions destroys health, media destroys information. The only way to create a healthy world is upon the Dharma [eternal law of nature] which is based upon racial separation, self determination and respect. A world based on truth such as this would not experience any of the violence and insanity that unsane, jewish created programs have caused. The record of history and of today is screaming this fact in our faces. Such a Dharmic world does not facilitate such problems as it does not create any basis for any. This is the healthy world the National Socialists [who where Satanists at the top] worked to give us. Salvation is in the Swastika. Which shall break the cross.

Cultural Marxism,2022-01-30,14:55:06,entryreqrd,Minds,,"BLM Indoctrination Hits Grade School Students Next Week With Nationwide ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter in Schools‚Äù By J.D. Rucker ‚Ä¢ Jan. 29, 2022 For Cultural Marxism to be successful, racism is required to instill division between the various races, religions, and sexual orientations. The only way to engage the masses in the cognitive dissonance required to embrace Cultural Marxist ideologies is to divide people into groups and pit those groups against each other. This is the premise behind Critical Race Theory, systemic racism, and Black Lives Matter. Despite claims that CRT isn‚Äôt taught in schools and BLM propaganda is not pushed, next week will see schools across the country pushing both concepts onto grade school students. Dubbed ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter in School Week,‚Äù teachers will be indoctrinating students into the belief that not all lives matter. They will be taught that the grievances of Black people are superior to the grievances of other races. Worst of all, they will be mixing in the other ‚Äúhidden‚Äù aspect of the BLM movement: LGBTQ+ superiority. Here‚Äôs a letter sent to parents of third-grade students at Arbor Heights Elementary in Seattle, Washington: Date: January 28, 2022 at 2:21:27 PM PST Subject: BLM at school week Jan. 31st-Feb. 4th Dear Third Grade Families, Next week, January 31st-February 4th is Black Lives Matter in Schools week. Third graders will participate in several lessons. These lessons are adapted from the Seattle Public Schools Ethnic Studies working group and center around themes of equity and justice. We wanted to let you know of our plans. Building on the foundation of celebration and acceptance we have planned lessons for this upcoming week. Our BLM week‚Äôs plan is below along with each day‚Äôs learning goal. If you have any questions or resources, feel free to contact your child‚Äôs teacher. Monday: Students will discuss race and bias by naming some of the reasons for the Black Lives Matter movement. Tuesday: Students will discuss shared behaviors, beliefs, and customs to understand culture. Wednesday: Students will be discussing the importance of treating others with respect regarding gender expression. Thursday: Students will be discussing intergenerational black families and black villages. Friday: Students will find emotions expressed in word by listening to ‚ÄúStill I Rise‚Äù by Maya Angelou. Sincerely, The 3rd Grade Team Ms. Parkinson Arbor Heights Elementary 3rd Grade Room 322 (206) 252-**** The curriculum for the week is designed to negate concepts such as ‚Äúall are created equal.‚Äù White students will be made to feel not only inferior but inherently racist based on the color of their skin. Meanwhile, students of color will be pushed to embrace the Neo-Marxist ideology that they are owed something based on their race or sexual orientation instead of merit. It‚Äôs the most destructive ideology raging across the nation today and is being pushed on school children for an entire week‚Ä¶ and beyond. The website for the group isn‚Äôt just pushing for the week. They want a ‚Äúyear of purpose‚Äù to be launched from the event. According to their website: In the wake of the murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, and others named and unnamed, a great Uprising for Black Lives has swept the nation and the world, inciting new urgency and radical possibilities for advancing abolitionist practice and uprooting institutional racism. As one would expect, there are events planned for the week that include demonizing law enforcement and pushing for defunding police. They‚Äôre no longer framing it as simple defunding. Instead, they make it into a false dichotomy by declaring that funding police means less funding for teachers and counselors.

This is t he unity of opposites in terms of two opposites opposing and negating each other (thesis vs. antithesis) and then getting united (synthesis) and then getting divided again into two new opposites to start a new cycle of uniting the opposites. It's not simply a repetition of the past, because the change in the quantity of the system leads to the change in the quality of the system, like an upgrade, escalation or ascension, which, due to the structural imbalance between the new opposites, will break the equilibrium to change the quantity of the new system, and so on and so forth.In this cycle of eternal clashing, uniting, ascending, and dividing, the opposites take different forms on the outside (e.g. religion, gender, racism, nation, empire, political ideology) but at the core, they are driven by the ""first driven force."" This ""first driven force"" is universal but can only be manifested through its specialties (like the forms).So there is a unity between universality and particularity, so considering the class tension as the main driven force (=universality) doesn't exclude but includes the role religion, gender etc. plays in the process.Marxism's story is about explaining this process in society.",argument cultural marxism exists methodologically projection marxist class division bourgeoisieproletariat oppressing classoppressed class onto social human category think malefemale whiteblack oldyoung etcbut problems argument blackwhite thinking form metaphysics marxism pits whole approach againstif want visualize dialectical materialism use gif collision two galaxies unity opposites terms two opposites opposing negating thesis vs antithesis getting united synthesis getting divided two new opposites start new cycle uniting opposites simply repetition past change quantity system leads change quality system like upgrade escalation ascension due structural imbalance new opposites break equilibrium change quantity new system forthin cycle eternal clashing uniting ascending dividing opposites take different forms outside eg religion gender racism nation empire political ideology core driven first driven force first driven force universal manifested specialties like formsso unity universality particularity considering class tension main driven force universality doesnt exclude includes role religion gender etc plays processmarxisms story explaining process society,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

 1. No. We don‚Äôt.
 
 2. No. We‚Äôre not.
 
 3. NO. YOU DON‚ÄôT.
 
 
 
 You don‚Äôt give a shit about freedom. You have no goddamn clue what the word even means.
 
 
 
 Libertarians have never fought for racists or traditionalists. Endorsement would be nice, but it isn‚Äôt necessary or even necessarily desirable. Traditionalists fight to be heard. Libertarians offer platforms only to other libertarians and to progressives with whom they sympathize. Any platform they offer to those who are conservative, traditionalist, or otherwise is grudging at best‚Äìtacitly condemned and stifled at worst. They offer endorsement to progressives, whether demanded by them or not. Libertarians as a group have already chosen their side‚Äìthey merely pretend not to have by promoting false equivalencies and pretending to stand for the rights of everyone. ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs right to express themselves is equal,‚Äù they say. But just like the progressives with whom they sympathize, some are ‚Äúmore equal‚Äù than others. They have favored sons. That is hardly a sin, but when their entire stance is the refusal to favor any son, it is a hypocrisy. And they refuse to acknowledge or admit it.
 
 
 
 Libertarians say this is not a particular problem. But it is. It is a very deep and concerning problem, because we fight enemies who will use our freedoms and rights as weapons against us. Agitators will come to meetings and shout us down, crying ‚Äúfree speech!‚Äù when they are ejected. Our enemies will form mobs to cause havoc and destruction when we assemble to discuss issues or share information, and cry ‚Äúfreedom to assemble!‚Äù when they are dispersed. Our opponents will slander us in the press with blatant distortions and outright lies, and when challenged or called out will hide behind freedom of the press. Oswald Mosley met this problem when he attempted to stop the United Kingdom from starting the Second World War. Yes, the UK started WWII. Communist agitators are masters of using the rights and freedoms of a nation to get their way. They will cut you with a knife, proclaim it ‚Äútheir right to do so,‚Äù and cry foul when you push them away or strike back in kind.
 
 
 
 This is why libertarian hypocrisy cannot be borne. Communists, socialists, Bolsheviks, and jews will forever and always use our freedoms and rights against us as poisoned daggers. The only way to stop it is to employ similar, if tempered, tactics. Older libertarians admit this. They finally admit, after decades of exposure of their ideology to the realities of the world, that a true libertarian society can only come about if all communists, hippies, marxist sympathizers, and welfare leeches are expelled and cast away.
 
 
 
 As for the matter of how this is to be done, they speak not one word. They see the problem, yes. Much like the handwringing progressives of Europe‚Äìwho see the foreign invaders as a problem, but say it is ‚Äúimpossible to deport them‚Äù‚Äìlibertarians offer not even the faintest hint of a solution. There is a solution. There is a solution to getting rid of cultural marxism, just as there is a solution to sending the invaders back. Like the progressives with whom they sympathize, libertarians pretend that what stands plainly before them is not really there. If they admit to seeing it, they deny and refuse it. They say, ‚ÄúThere must be some other way!‚Äù as though this situation can be solved without violence or compromising their libertarian mores and morality. They are wrong. This will never be solved peacefully. The enemy will not permit it. The enemies of the West are fanatics who believe they are ‚Äúsaving the world from itself.‚Äù They will die for what they believe, running the streets red with blood before they go. If you are not prepared to do the same to stop them‚Äìlet alone to begin reversing the tide of what they have done‚Äìit is tantamount to conceding defeat right now. There are no lengths to which a rabid dog will not go to bite a man. It must be put down.
 
 
 
 Let‚Äôs look at immigration. Western talking heads refuse to admit that the invaders could easily be rebuffed. They came here under their own power, and by the will of the governments importing them. They can also leave under their own power. If, for example, Europeans started executing every Muslim they saw, the problem would sort itself out in under a year. Any who were not killed would willingly self-deport, being made to fear what lay before them more than what they fled. The same solution exists for cultural marxism‚Äìall the flavors of socialism and communism‚Äìand the quisling opportunists that push it. To fight them by abiding by their own rules is to propose the raising up of an entire nation within a nation. It would mean a second America (or second European state) preaching the truth to counter their lies, a second media machine, a second governmental process, a second source of mass information. This is categorically impossible to accomplish. Even if it weren‚Äôt, those in power would not permit its existence. The leviathan of the state would not stand idly by as you erected a behemoth to fight it from within. Libertarians admit that the threat must be removed, but they choose to ignore that it will never go willingly, and that it will fight to the death to fulfill its purpose and nature. Force is the one and only solution. Libertarians think this is foul, disgusting, altogether too barbaric, downright ‚Äúfascist,‚Äù and‚Äìworst of all‚Äìthat most wicked of libertarian sins: authoritarian. So the libertarian will never act with force. He will ‚Äúplead the Fifth‚Äù on the matter even as he is being lowered into his own grave.
 
 Even if libertarians had fought for my right to speak the truth, that means next to nothing. Am I to overlook a man stabbing me in the back with a knife because he once passed me the salt or held open a door for me? The forces arrayed against us use the rights we value to kill us and everything we hold dear. Under the guise of ‚Äúfreedoms‚Äù like the right to assembly and the right to free speech, the actual rights of free speech and freedom to assemble are being unmade through naked terrorism disguised as ‚Äúthe will of the people.‚Äù The only positions libertarians can take on this matter are as follows:
 
 
 
 1. Stand aside and permit those who are willing to do what must be done
 
 2. Join us and fight back
 
 3. Stand by their principles as hypocritically as they do now, but show them towards us instead
 
 
 
 The libertarian masses choose none of these. Thus, they are part of the problem, not the solution. These are just the problems with libertarianism that appear when confronted with the single issue of cultural marxism. They go far deeper than this. Libertarianism promotes the individual over all other concerns, and as such libertarianism is the suicide of culture and nation both. Libertarianism would not enforce changes necessary to fix a nation‚Äôs ills, because the concentration of the power to do so is condemned for its own sake, merely for existing. They promote free trade, which breaks the back of any economy that exploits it. Free trade is only viable if all concerned trade partners engage in equal trade, and they never will. Thus, it is a policy of being taken advantage of and will always ultimately lead to jobs and labor being outsourced to foreign bidders and wealth flowing out of the nation and into the pockets of international corporate interests.
 
 
 
 Libertarians claim that progressiveness is only a problem when it is imposed on people by their government. They fail to realize that the government will always be biased towards a political ideology. Not only that, it should be. Joseph McCarthy‚Äôs bias for American traditionalism‚Äìand against communism‚Äìis what protected America from communism. But for the grace of God that he could have gotten all of them instead of merely a handful, we would not have many of the problems that we do today. We‚Äôll discuss the libel against McCarthy later.
 
 
 
 The government will always force the ideals of those who hold office upon the people. Thus, the government will always be vulnerable to subversion by intrusive and malicious alien elements. It is not a self-correcting system. It must be corrected. Communism and socialism did not form in a vacuum. Just like how women have been granted equal rights many times before in the history of human civilization‚Äìonly to have those civilizations collapse soon after‚Äìit is a symptom of a greater scourge of the entropy of civilization and the decay of society. ‚ÄúSexual liberation,‚Äù female equality, and communist policies will always be harbingers of the end for a society. Libertarians attempt to embrace this volatile and poisonous progressive culture, insisting that it can be preserved and is even, somehow, inherently good. This betrays their naked ignorance and na√Øvet√© on the subject. It was progressive culture that caused these problems. It is liberalism that brought us to this point, it is egalitarianism that allowed this to happen, and it is individualism, before all, that permitted it to foment. To preserve modern culture‚Äìinsisting on conservative law and fiscal policy‚Äìis to replace a rotten fruit with a fresh one, but scoop out the festering heart of the rotten and transplant it into the healthy. It is painting over rust instead of sanding it away. The culture dictates everything, because it controls the wills and wants of the people.
 
 
 
 This is why cultural marxism has been so effective. A nation is held aloft from the very bottommost rung, and that bottom rung is the family‚Äìthe smallest microcosm of civilization. A family is a group of related people who share space, genetics, and ideas. A group of families is a locality, a group of localities is a city or region, a group of cities or regions is a state, and a state either stands on its own, or itself comprises a group of states that form a nation. Thus, all of civilization is supported by the family.
 
 This is why the single most successful communist psychological operation ever executed was the feminist one‚Äìi.e. the one that attacked the family unit itself. This is no accident. This was by design. This was a poison dart crafted specifically to bring the Western world to its knees and ultimately destroy it, and it is a poison that has outlived the assassins that cast it and will be the death of us yet if we cannot stop it. To refuse to take a stand against the degeneration of society and culture‚Äìto try to ‚Äústay above it‚Äù‚Äìis to be complicit with its blatant and overt destruction. The man who stands by and watches as the gates are lifted and the barbarians let loose upon the city is complicit in the act of the gate raiser.
 
 
 
 Libertarians would stuff their ears with cotton and gibber of cycles of ‚Äúleft‚Äù and ‚Äúright,‚Äù completely ignoring that even the right-wing of today would be viewed as buffoons, imbeciles, and utter madmen by the conservatives of as little as 50 years ago. A libertarian is someone who sees the spinning wheel of the left vs. right dichotomy and says, ‚ÄúThis is a natural cycle of the rotation of ideas,‚Äù blind to the cart to which the wheel is attached which is rolling down a hill and off of a cliff. They say to a man who would halt the spinning wheel, ‚ÄúYou have no right to do that; the spinning of the wheel is natural.‚Äù To a man who would dare to reverse it, they hurl their most dire insults‚Äì‚Äúauthoritarian‚Äù and ‚Äúfascist.‚Äù But the progressive ideology is the most authoritarian of all. Libertarians often cite the Founding Fathers of America as their inspiration. The Founding Fathers of the United States were unashamedly national socialists.

In some of these cases, I've done what I can to teach their kids reading/writing/counting because this is some of the only proper attention they get. But I can only do so much, since the bratty children and brattier parents are so gung-ho against books/knowledge/tradition etc.

They are too easily-offended and potentially-violent, and completely resistant to American Tradition or any other aspect of normalcy (nuclear family, tact and politeness, proper work ethic, the Golden Rule, etc.) The only real reason I ever risk going around them is for the sake of their kids, so they will have some example of proper adult behavior and guidance (and help with reading/writing/counting, so school won't be such a culture shock.)

This is because they weren't taught world history since the early 1990's, which was the agenda of the American Communist Party for a reason. The average American will tell you ""Communism is dead, they tore down the Berlin Wall,"" while conveniently leaving out the part that it is still alive and well in China, North Korea, and Vietnam. They also leave out the fact that cultural Marxism has taken over Europe, Canada, and Australia and is trying to gain a foothold in America largely because of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Stalin's Murders Writing in Slavic Review, demographers Barbara Anderson and Brian Silver maintained that limited census data make a precise death count impossible. Instead, they offer a probable range of 3.2 to 5.5 million excess deaths for the entire Soviet Union from 1926 to 1939, a period that covers collectivization, the civil war in the countryside, the purges of the late 1930s and major epidemics of typhus and malaria. Some historians claim that the death toll was around 20 million, a figure based on Conquest's book ""The Great Terror"" (1968), with some estimates relying in part on demographic losses such as Conquest's. In 2001, American historian Richard Pipes argued that the population had decreased by 9 to 10 million people from the 1932 to 1939 censuses. In 2003, British historian Simon Sebag Montefiore suggested that Stalin was ultimately responsible for the deaths of at least 20 million people. In 2006, political scientist Rudolph Rummel wrote that the earlier higher victim total estimates are correct, although he included those killed by the government of the Soviet Union in other Eastern European countries as well. Historians have also stated that at the onset of World War 2, Stalin was worried he would not be able to conscript enough soldiers to defend against an invasion by Germany's Nazis because he had already murdered millions of his own countrymen. https://www.bitchute.com/video/xAbBMJSaci5T/ The American Communist Party changed their name to the Congressional Progressive Caucus in the mid-1990's to deflect from the nation who they were and what they stood for.

The theory is heavily influenced by the writings of Antonio Gramsci.[1] Neo-Gramscianism analyzes how the particular constellation of social forces, the state and the dominant ideational configuration define and sustain world orders. In this sense, the neo-Gramscian approach breaks the decades-old stalemate between the realist schools of thought and the liberal theories by historicizing the very theoretical foundations of the two streams as part of a particular world order and finding the interlocking relationship between agency and structure. Karl Polanyi, Karl Marx, Max Weber, Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno and Michel Foucault are cited as major sources within the critical theory of IR.[1]Critical Theory (capitalized) also refers specifically to a school of thought practiced by the Frankfurt School theoreticians Herbert Marcuse, Theodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Erich Fromm, and Max Horkheimer. In addition to its roots in the first-generation Frankfurt School, critical theory has also been influenced by Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs and Antonio Gramsci. Additionally, second-generation Frankfurt School scholars have been influential, notably J√ºrgen Habermas. In Habermas's work, critical theory transcended its theoretical roots in German idealism and progressed closer to American pragmatism. Concern for social ""base and superstructure"" is one of the remaining Marxist philosophical concepts in much contemporary critical theory.[6]:5‚Äì8",without joking isnt cultural marxism gramscianism critical theoryneogramscianism applies critical theory approach study international relations ir global political economy gpe explores interface ideas institutions material capabilities shape specific contours state formation theory heavily influenced writings antonio gramsci neogramscianism analyzes particular constellation social forces state dominant ideational configuration define sustain world orders sense neogramscian approach breaks decadesold stalemate realist schools thought liberal theories historicizing theoretical foundations two streams part particular world order finding interlocking relationship agency structure karl polanyi karl marx max weber max horkheimer theodor adorno michel foucault cited major sources within critical theory ircritical theory capitalized also refers specifically school thought practiced frankfurt school theoreticians herbert marcuse theodor adorno walter benjamin erich fromm max horkheimer addition roots firstgeneration frankfurt school critical theory also influenced gy√∂rgy luk√°cs antonio gramsci additionally secondgeneration frankfurt school scholars influential notably j√ºrgen habermas habermass work critical theory transcended theoretical roots german idealism progressed closer american pragmatism concern social base superstructure one remaining marxist philosophical concepts much contemporary critical theory‚äì,0,3,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Cultural Marxism,2022-08-19,14:04:24,AquariusNL,Minds,https://www.minds.com/newsfeed/1407364588483121160,"http://expandourmind.com/2017/07/24/pope-francis-top-religious-leaders-promote-world-state-world-religion/Pope Francis And Other Top Religious Leaders Promote World State And World Religion‚Ä¶ 2017-07-24Many of our readers might have noticed that many religious leaders these days seem to have lost faith in their own religion. At the same time they focus more and more on political issues that they deem more important than religion. You could say that they are more interested in human politics than religious issues.In 2014 Pope Francis introduced muslim prayers at the Vatican and said that any relationship with Jesus outside the Church s very dangerous. Such comments make everyone wonder about his own faith and Al Gore the former American Vice-President asked: ‚ÄùIs the pope catholic?‚Äù. In addition he uses the bent cross of Jesus Christ which reminds us of Satanist crosses.In 2016 Pope Francis blessed the new ‚ÄùBlack Pope‚Äù, the Jesuit Adolfo Sosa to become ‚ÄùSuperior General‚Äù of the infamous jesuit order.Historically the black pope is rumored to rule the ‚Äùwhite pope‚Äù that we see on the television. They were infamous sorcerers and subverters in old times. The Jesuit order was excommunicated from the Catholic Church in the 1700s due to their treasonous activities but got reinstated after a few decades. Today the popes are both from the same jesuit order, and Mr Sosa sent a letter of appreciation in 1989 to Fidel Castro, the Cuban communist dictator. He has also appointed marxist ‚Äùcatholics‚Äù to the top positions within the Jesuit order. It¬¥s more and more clear that the whole Christian church has been hijacked by the atheist, globalist priests.In January 2016 the Vatican released a video in which Pope Francis declared that all of the major world religions are ‚Äùseeking God or meeting God in different ways‚Äù and that ultimately ‚Äùwe are all children of God‚Äù. Pope Francis has repeatedly pushed for a world religion during the last few years and it means that he wants to kill his own religion ‚Äì Christianity. If that is not a treasonous activity against his own believers what is? Did he ask Christians if they want to kill Christianity? He simply advances the globalist agenda of a world state and a world religion and he does it more and more openly.The latest speech, which took place on June 25 2017, is merely the latest eyebrow-raising announcement by the liberal Pope. A Pope is not supposed to intervene in politics but this is exactly what our Pope does. Pope Francis told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that the United States of America has ‚Äúa distorted vision of the world‚Äù and Americans must be ruled by a world government, as soon as possible, ‚Äúfor their own good.‚ÄùThe week before he also called for ‚Äúa one world government‚Äù and ‚Äúpolitical authority‚Äù, arguing that the creation of the one world government is needed to combat major issues such as ‚Äúclimate change.‚ÄùSpeaking with Ecuador‚Äôs El Universo newspaper, the Pope said that the United Nations doesnt have enough power and must be granted full governmental control ‚Äúfor the good of humanity.‚Äù The globalization movement cannot be underestimated. It is the process of transitioning the world into a global government and eroding the rights of the individual. World religious leaders, led by the increasingly anti-Christian Pope Francis, are playing their part in this great deception.David Rockefeller famously said that a ‚Äúglobal crisis‚Äù would have to occur before the people of the world would be willing to accept a New World Order. Sure enough, when the world economy suffered a dramatic crash in 2008, world leaders again proclaimed the need for a New World Order with global financial control.As demonstrated by Pope Francis, climate change and global warming is now the global elite‚Äôs preferred method of scaremongering, as they attempt to shepherd humanity closer to unified totalitarian rule.Pope Francis is determined to steer his flock away from Jesus. The pontiff who held Islamic prayers in the Vatican, and later warned his followers not to enter into a personal relationship with Jesus, is obviously no Christian with a sinister agenda.The jesuit pope is a key player in the plan to usher in a New World Order(NWO), determined to mislead his flock while catering to the global cabal of satanists playing other roles in their grand scheme such as politicians, advisors, militaries, doctors, media tycoons and super bankers. Conclusion ‚Äì The End Of Christianity As We Know ItCollapseChristianity collapses ‚Äì the end of our civilization as we know it?Does Pope Francis care about Jesus? It seems like he is merely a tool of the globalist NWO group of people trying to impose a world state with their own manmade world religion to the world¬¥s people. They promote mass migration, cultural marxism and endless tolerance to LGBT people and other modern phenomena which have always been heretic in Christianity. At the same time the Christian clergy has been exposed with an abundance of pedophiles and other degenerated phenomena completely against the ten commandments of Jesus.Enlightened man Emanuel Swedenborg said that winter signifies the end of the church and in Norse myth we can read the following prophecy about the ‚ÄùFimbul Winter‚Äù preceding Ragnarokkr:‚ÄùFimbulwinter is three successive winters, when snow comes in from all directions, without any intervening summer. Then, there will be innumerable wars.‚Äù (Source: Wikipedia)The event is described primarily in the Poetic Edda.Pope Francis ascended his throne in 2013 and gradually he has become more and more radical and political. You could say that the three final years of completely demonic Christianity has passed by now and we expect the next phase to start in line with the predictions of the Norse myth and many other prophets and influential world leaders. The positive thing is that death also means rebirth and there will be survivors from Ragnarokkr according to Norse myth just like the Bible states that the faithful will survive the End of Times in the Bible. It is believed that the next civilization will be more wondrous than any previous civilization based on the terrifying experiences of our current period of time ‚Äì the Devil¬¥s days as the Knight Templar Prophecy calls them.",httpexpandourmindcompopefrancistopreligiousleaderspromoteworldstateworldreligionpope francis top religious leaders promote world state world religion‚ä¶ many readers might noticed many religious leaders days seem lost faith religion time focus political issues deem important religion could say interested human politics religious issuesin pope francis introduced muslim prayers vatican said relationship jesus outside church dangerous comments make everyone wonder faith al gore former american vicepresident asked ‚äùis pope catholic‚äù addition uses bent cross jesus christ reminds us satanist crossesin pope francis blessed new ‚äùblack pope‚äù jesuit adolfo sosa become ‚äùsuperior general‚äù infamous jesuit orderhistorically black pope rumored rule ‚äùwhite pope‚äù see television infamous sorcerers subverters old times jesuit order excommunicated catholic church due treasonous activities got reinstated decades today popes jesuit order mr sosa sent letter appreciation fidel castro cuban communist dictator also appointed marxist ‚äùcatholics‚äù top positions within jesuit order it¬¥s clear whole christian church hijacked atheist globalist priestsin january vatican released video pope francis declared major world religions ‚äùseeking god meeting god different ways‚äù ultimately ‚äùwe children god‚äù pope francis repeatedly pushed world religion last years means wants kill religion ‚äì christianity treasonous activity believers ask christians want kill christianity simply advances globalist agenda world state world religion openlythe latest speech took place june merely latest eyebrowraising announcement liberal pope pope supposed intervene politics exactly pope pope francis told italian newspaper la repubblica united states america ‚äúa distorted vision world‚äù americans must ruled world government soon possible ‚äúfor good‚äùthe week also called ‚äúa one world government‚äù ‚äúpolitical authority‚äù arguing creation one world government needed combat major issues ‚äúclimate change‚äùspeaking ecuador‚äôs el universo newspaper pope said united nations doesnt enough power must granted full governmental control ‚äúfor good humanity‚äù globalization movement underestimated process transitioning world global government eroding rights individual world religious leaders led increasingly antichristian pope francis playing part great deceptiondavid rockefeller famously said ‚äúglobal crisis‚äù would occur people world would willing accept new world order sure enough world economy suffered dramatic crash world leaders proclaimed need new world order global financial controlas demonstrated pope francis climate change global warming global elite‚äôs preferred method scaremongering attempt shepherd humanity closer unified totalitarian rulepope francis determined steer flock away jesus pontiff held islamic prayers vatican later warned followers enter personal relationship jesus obviously christian sinister agendathe jesuit pope key player plan usher new world ordernwo determined mislead flock catering global cabal satanists playing roles grand scheme politicians advisors militaries doctors media tycoons super bankers conclusion ‚äì end christianity know itcollapsechristianity collapses ‚äì end civilization know itdoes pope francis care jesus seems like merely tool globalist nwo group people trying impose world state manmade world religion world¬¥s people promote mass migration cultural marxism endless tolerance lgbt people modern phenomena always heretic christianity time christian clergy exposed abundance pedophiles degenerated phenomena completely ten commandments jesusenlightened man emanuel swedenborg said winter signifies end church norse myth read following prophecy ‚äùfimbul winter‚äù preceding ragnarokkr‚äùfimbulwinter three successive winters snow comes directions without intervening summer innumerable wars‚äù source wikipediathe event described primarily poetic eddapope francis ascended throne gradually become radical political could say three final years completely demonic christianity passed expect next phase start line predictions norse myth many prophets influential world leaders positive thing death also means rebirth survivors ragnarokkr according norse myth like bible states faithful survive end times bible believed next civilization wondrous previous civilization based terrifying experiences current period time ‚äì devil¬¥s days knight templar prophecy calls,0,0,1,3,1,0,1,1,0,0,0

Cultural Marxism,2022-11-19,0:00:39,albertcurtis369,Minds,https://www.minds.com/newsfeed/1440491935335714827,"Liberalism has ran its course, passing the torch to its heir, Cultural Marxism, which has festered, and the fever while still high is receding. This entire episode in Western History is akin to the last fever dreams of a powerful sickness that nearly had us dead but from which we have rise to find LIFE. Now the cultural sickness will birth its own destruction. The attempt to destroy White America with mass immigration has the White Majority riled up as they simply have NO interest in becoming a minority among minorities by and large ‚Äì They shall judge PC by it own metrics, and given the hemlock in it own measure ‚Äì as for Me so for Thee. They can harp about tolerance all they like, but Territoriality among all gregarious mammals is a fact. It cannot be simply wished away. So is racial identity which has as solid basis in biology as well as cultural historical identities which for all the vitriol from the left is STILL more real than their ‚Äòconstruct‚Äô gibberish -- biology and the past have weight as a fact of natural affections, behavioral instinct affects action -- this is just reality. Sex is real; gender is invented fantasy. Creation has RULES ... Life results from following them; Death comes of defying them.Part of these rules is that each kind has a place that is theirs to have, rule or command as they wish free from outside interference ‚Äì otherwise the Natural normal expected result is conflict and death. This is predicated upon the TRUTH that groups are primary not persons, who only exist as living intensities inside a group of at minimum a family. This is life affirming Nationalist Truth.Nationalism posits that every nation is unique -- nations being BLOOD Related Peoples with similar language, history, customs and culture. Nationalism posits that each nation has a RIGHT to rule its own territory for the advantage of its group ALONE ‚Äì We say OPENLY that Inclusion of others is a SICKNESS and that EXCLUSION is healthy normal and good. So the upside is that Blacks, Browns, Reds and Yellows are NOT of our nation they merely LIVE in our country. Only the Whites in North America are of our Nation sticky speaking but by a bit of extension ALL WHITES who are English Speaking among the wreck of the British Empire are our Kin and will be treated as Nationals of our Ethno State ‚Äì which could in potential be the GREATEST STATE to ever have existed in population, size, resource base and technological/intellectual vigor. But liberalism demands ‚Äòdiversity‚Äô IE DEATH CULT instead. Liberalism proposes that PERSONS IE Individuals are primary and thus denies even the possiblity of the FAMILY as a unit that has wholeness, going far beyond a mere contract among individuals. They are death cult because they exclude, diminish or contaminate all that leads to life.Diversity, Tolerance and Inclusoin at the maximal logical extension requires that no singular Nation or even stable majority have sole power at least the Globalist Multicultural Version does ‚Äì Which is the ONLY officially allowed version, so called ‚Äòclassical liberalism‚Äô hides among the Shadows even more deeply than Nationalism Proper theses days. The Liberal-PC-Money-Lender monstrosity is the rule of the wealthiest few, under guise of legal language about 'democracy' ‚Äòequality‚Äô ‚Äòtolerance‚Äô ‚Äòinclusion‚Äô and ‚Äòdiversity‚Äô as holy noble goals that bring goodness in and of themselves ‚Äì It is all an insane fiction. The legally enforced equality et al. under the Usurers‚Äô lawyers is not tenable long term as it attempts to shape reality by use, control and contortion of words rather than describe reality using correct words. It attempts to use courts to brow beat people into saying that 4 is 5; that wet is dry. It uses threat of naked force and subtle shaming to ensure that we each and all will deny reality, and say the insanity they prescribe for us. What of the Elite? Are they ‚Äòdenying‚Äô or just insane? Clueless. They are removed from the problems only seeing the cream. Thus, The elite have nothing to deny ‚Ä¶ for them 4=5 since all things are truly great from behind the gate. White Black Red, they all pay for the Stead.They thus can truly believe that every can equally care for and love all others to each other -- absurd as that sounds -- because it is possible to say such a thing in legal language and because it sounds ‚Äògood‚Äô. They also can crow about nonsense like ‚Äòwe are all equal but diversity is truly our strength‚Äô among other contradictory and self negating concepts. Legalism is abstract and removed from normal human intercourse, value judgements and action. Liberalism took on an immense dosage of lawyer babble, it too is far removed from human reality being at best an absurd sophisticated model, that uses legalistic language to SOUND correct. This inhuman disregard for the normal bonds of affection among groups of people, will come back to bite it just as it did the commie experiment in Eastern Europe ‚Äì Marxism being liberalism‚Äôs inbred bastard after all. Why do these systems collapse, you might ask? Humans seek to have a stable ‚Äòcircle‚Äô of wife, children, grandchildren ‚Ä¶ this is natural. Liberalism‚Äôs ‚Äòhumanity‚Äô is NOT natural or real. Add to this mechanical view of human nature an inclination to promote every death inducing fad, life style or action they can find and it is assured they will fail from nature's good graces. We are thinking of primarily FEMINISM, SODOMY, and Gender Equality ‚Äì ALL against Natural affection, all pillars of death cult.To all this is added the fact that Liberalism and its Marxist Brood deny INHERENT NATURE to man, insisting he is ‚Äòclay‚Äô to be shaped at whim. This simple assertion has caused MILLIONS OF DEATHS as Nature resists the ‚Äòshaping‚Äô and the Liberal/Marxist has to KILL the man to ‚Äòremake‚Äô his reality, economic, social, political, or otherwise. Human Nature will only bend and twist so far before it lashed out and sets itself back to normalcy. Therefore nationalism based on Family, home, hearth, heritage, which leads naturally to a shared commonality of history and culture in the context of a community of folk will prevail as it is the normalcy that most people seek. In its ways are life, happiness and purpose for the person and greater folk together in collaboration to the common good. We are talking about real organic Nationalism among Whites in America which is growing in spite of the liberals, commies,and useful idiots among the so called ""right"" as well.¬† This is because life will not be denied and in nationalism lies life. We are not talking about internutz 'white nationalism'. No, that is just as worthless as ever, and is in fact a joke. It is in fact an albatross that keep the potential cadre class of the future nationalist folk state fixated upon fantasy 'race wars' rather than working to organize those of their class -- each person has a 'class' we are not Marxists after all -- to the common ends of ALL classes and castes that are loyal to the common good of Whites such that when PC becomes weak we will be well placed to inherent these OUR RIGHTFUL LANDS back from its tyrannical grasp.It is this lack of a proper leadership caste among Nationalist minded folk, coupled to a lack of small successive goals that lead to larger things, that more than anything holds them in bondage to their enemies will. It keeps them from having a 'vision' a dream that motivates beyond mere personal gain or glory.¬† Leadership =/= Politicians ... Leaders do more than talk. They perform. They make things happen in the world of real things. They do WHAT is needed without fail, regardless of popularity or polls. They DIRECTLY ensure their people have the things needed for life before all other things, wealth exists for the GOOD of the FOLK not for vanity. Leadership like Nobility is about SERVICE and DUTY.¬† Less Talk and More Walk would be the most ideal thing.The Elite of the Western World are NOT leaders .. ONLY PIMP PoliticiansSo here we are at the end of the Materialist/Marxist/Liberal world era and at the start of the growth of a new Nationalism that will grow into the new world paradigm given

 During the 19th century, various awakening movements swept across much of Europe and North America, in Denmark, it manifested in two camps. The so-called ""Association for the Inner Mission in Denmark""(""Inner Mission"" for short) and then the Grundtvigians, an awakening movement largely build by, and around the teachings of, the Priest-Poet-Politician, Nikolai Frederik Severin Grundtvig.
 
 The former of the two movements, which earned itself the nicknames ""the saved"" or ""the woke"" was, and somewhat still is, a movement very much in line with what most people think of, when they think of 19th century Christian revivalism: very conservative, very focused on the damnation of false believers, on sin, and so on. It was very much against dancing and gambling and drinking and anything _fun_ really. But contrary to where it is located now, it started out being hugely popular in many of the major towns and cities, and actually among the richer rural areas. As time moved on however, it was pushed out, either it fell out of favour in the areas it was strong in, and it's body of core adherents changed. It became increasingly popular out West, in the harsher areas of Western Jutland, and changed much of its base to fishermen, and the poorer farmers who lived in the area. It started to disappear from the major towns and cities, and became increasingly rural, and increasingly focused along the West coast. It had become hard Christianity for hard conditions.
 
 Meanwhile, the other movement, the Grundtvigians, led by N.F.S. Grundtvig, was known as ""the happy Christians."" While being of the same movement, Evangelical revivalism, it was very different in character. While all the core concepts are the same, born-again, mission, salvation through faith, and so-on, Grundtvig's line was much more in line with Luther's line of a merciful God, and with an idea of the Earthly life as something to be enjoyed. There were no bans on drinking or dancing, women were allowed to preach, and so-on. A fairly progressive movement, for its times. It was also associated with the young liberal movement in Denmark, an increasingly agrarian movement, so much, that Grundtvig, the Evangelical preacher, ended up becoming perhaps _the most recognised_ ""founding father"" in Denmark, and one of the most famous members of the Constitutional Assembly, that wrote Denmark's first liberal constitution. This Grundtvigian-Evangelical movement was also associated with the cooperative movement, and was popular among the rural poor and the smaller farmers, as it helped them compete and gain independence from the large dairies and industrial mills, and allowed them to form their own consumer cooperatives, breaking the monopolies many rural communities were caught under.
 
 The Grundtvigian form of Evangelical Christianity ended up becoming largely the standard in Denmark, as the older forms were increasingly surpassed, as the Inner Mission was pushed out west, and as many churches in the major cities started to dabble with Kierkegaard and a more ""dead"" faith, based in the lack of meaning of the world.
 
 So that's the story of the ""Woke"" movement in Denmark. I think it is fair to say that, perhaps, Denmark is the place in Europe, where the Evangelical awakening movement, usually associated with the American Bible-belt and the so-called ""Evangelical vote"" became the most powerful, and had the most influence. Where it became lifted to a _de-facto_ national religion.

Cultural Marxism,2021-12-31,12:38:45,abgreport,Minds,,"https://www.lewrockwell.com/2021/12/allan-stevo/the-new-york-times-explains-that-mask-wearing-helps-to-rewire-children/ Pro tip: Google and The New York Times have a business arrangement that makes subscription-free reading easier. If you don‚Äôt want to prop up this once great newspaper by buying a New York Times subscription, then do this: Whenever you hit a New York Times paywall, you can just copy and paste the URL into a Google search and click on the top return in order to view that New York Times article for free. Shouldn‚Äôt I Feel Bad Doing That? You should feel no shame in doing this. The New York Times has spent years in total decline into mere propaganda rag for the uniparty establishment and deserves no propping up. May the Gray Lady die a swift and quiet death so that she can at least go back, even if only in the memory of man, to be known for the generally noble efforts that once took place within those pages, pages that once great men and women wrote for. Though the institution has doubtlessly been fraught with foibles and scandals over its history, this exemplary list of writers includes the brilliant free market mind Henry Hazlitt. Hazlitt was once an editor for The New York Times and frequent writer of the unsigned editorials that represented the official opinions of the Times editorial board. Though efforts to reform and prevent this decline of The New York Times have taken place, the paper has moved so far away from truthful coverage and honest debate that Hazlitt would no longer be allowed past security in that building today. Though some New Yorkers are renown for the provincial style of blindness that allows one to look around a rat infested city covered in grime, garbage, and now desolation, and uncritically call everything in New York ‚Äúthe best,‚Äù I write this praise of the once great New York Times as a Midwesterner who was once an avid reader of the Sunday pages of this once excellent publication, and recognize what a loss it is for American society that it has descended so far into the abyss. Please Forgive The Delay, But The Egregious Nature Of This Piece Still Deserves Addressing I‚Äôve been working on my next book (Face Masks Hurt Kids is due for release soon) since August, which means I have failed to comment on some of the more egregious topics of the face mask debate since that time. The New York Times opinion piece ‚ÄúActually, Wearing a Mask Can Help Your Child Learn,‚Äù by Judith Danovitch would be one of them. Danovitch‚Äôs piece was published in mid-August 2021 as courageous parents near and far were increasingly standing up for their children at school board meetings in droves. The article deserves far more criticism than it has, to date, received. Greater than 50% of the 757-word article belittles the wise and natural concerns of parents that masks are harmful and perhaps even dangerous for their children. That is unfortunate, for we already live in an era that seeks to be so discouraging of good parental behavior that additional discouragement is unheeded and redundant. A good aspect of the article is that Danovitch speaks a great deal of truth in the article, she just twists it in such an unethical and manipulative way that it is very difficult to recognize that truth. In the next few minutes, I am going to try to twist her words back into shape here so that the truth is clearer, and it is easier to read between the lines. To give you a sense of who the writer is, let us begin by pointing to the ethics of a mother who eagerly plays mad scientist with her child. This Biography From A Professional May Shock You In what I will admit is an ad hominem intended to illustrate this writer‚Äôs poor ethics around boundaries, Dr. Danovitch considers her child to be ‚Äúher favorite research subject,‚Äù as stated in her biography below. ‚ÄúJudith Danovitch, Ph.D. grew up in New York speaking English, Spanish, and Hebrew. After earning degrees from Harvard and Yale, she became a psychology professor. She teaches child development courses and studies how children think and learn. Her favorite research subject is her own child, who is bilingual in English and Hebrew.‚Äù Children are awesome to observe and learn from. Children are not appropriate to do research on. When research must be conducted, it must be done with the most significant ethical considerations. Children cannot give their informed consent. Parents must. To make a parent both lead researcher and unconflicted provider of informed consent is nearly impossible. One must be placed before the other. In the case of Danovitch, as one can see from the biography, the role of researcher appears to be the role she places in first position. Based on this, and other aspects of her professional efforts and parental efforts disclosed through her writing, I fear Danovitch has put a great deal of effort into sentencing her poor child to an adulthood on the therapist‚Äôs couch. Knowing so many members of the New York raised intelligentsia, I suspect Danovitch does not see this as a problem in the least. As if the awful New York Times op-ed did not already speak volumes, Danovitch‚Äôs above biography for Kveller.com demonstrates that she has all the right credentials and all the right ethical lapses to be able to write this deceitful New York Times article. When encountering deceitful work in establishment rags, you need to be especially careful to ask yourself, ‚ÄúWhat is the author really trying to say?‚Äù Though couched in pleasant, or at least palatable, language, sometimes what the author is real trying to say is about as vile as it gets. The art of being a talking head for the mainstream technocratic class is the art of being able to speak the most vile notions in the most calming tones and in the most disarming language. If an audience member begins to gently slip into sleep or even into a hypnotic trance while encountering your calming, gentle words, so much the better. As long as the audience cannot see vile as vile, all is well. New York Times: If You Let Them Make The Most Of This Crisis, They Will Use Masks To Mess Up Your Children In the Machiavellian spirit of the man, Rahm Emanuel, Washington D.C.-insider-cum-transitional-Chicago-mayor, has been known to say ‚ÄúNever let a good crisis go to waste.‚Äù Chicagoans once called Chicago ‚Äúthe city that works,‚Äù because for all its wicked corruption, the city fathers at least made sure that the place was enjoyable to live in and possible to raise a family in, looked clean, that checkbooks got balanced, and that the roads got plowed and salted almost as quickly as the snow fell. Before so many other parts of the country knew the pain sky-high taxes, Chicagoans put up with the corruption and graft because at least it was a fairly well maintained place. Emmanuel was the one who helped remove the relatively effective, though scumbag-filled, democratic machine that the city once new and prepared the way for the utter degeneracy and cultural Marxism that the city now knows. Perhaps there is nothing wrong with benefiting from a crisis that someone else created. However, sometimes one wonders how frequently this Machiavellian view around crisis caused Emanuel to manufacture crises with the intent of seizing greater control. Danovitch echoes this same Machiavellian approach to crisis and states truthfully her psychotic opinion in the last sentence of her New York Times article. It is the most telling sentence of the article and a lens by which to decode the rest of the article. ‚ÄúMasks are hopefully not here to stay, but while they are still necessary, we should make the most of them.‚Äù What does Danovitch mean by ‚Äúmake the most of them?‚Äù Though Danovitch, in that article, is critical of a Utah mom who was concerned about the impact of public health mandates ‚Äúrewiring‚Äù the brains of children, Danovitch spends the article going through the importance of using masks to do exactly that ‚Äî to rewire the brains of our children. Likely without intending to, Danovitch makes a compelling argument for how effective masks are at that. New York Times: Masks Distract Children And Prevent Them From Focus On More Important Matters For many people, their finest creative moments take place when they have no cell signal or when the phone battery dies, when it is the early morning hours or late hours, or when they close themselves up and hunker down on a project. In such a moment, that person is able to limit distraction of daily life and to focus. Until the power goes out, it is almost hard to realize how distracted one is by the din of daily life, and how much one misses what life is like absent that noise. In such moments one finds the ‚Äúsignal‚Äù of life and not just the noise. In such moments, one learns to rely on ones own available faculties. Danovitch seems to write applaudingly about that calm environment in which one can pay attention, but she is in fact writing applaudingly about the very opposite ‚Äî distraction: ‚ÄúWearing a mask can also help teach children to pay more attention to their own bodies and physical behaviors.‚Äù Here, Danovitch writes ‚Äúpay attention,‚Äù but she really means the exact opposite. She is talking about distraction. Instead of a child paying attention to what he or she really wants to focus on, the child is paying attention to a distraction ‚Äî a face mask. To pay attention to a distraction is to be distracted. To be distracted is the opposite of to pay attention. Do you see what Danovitch did here? She used the antonym in place of the word that fit. She communicated the opposite. Using an antonym in place of a word that fits is called lying. This is one of the techniques of the chattering classes, intended to lull you into comfort in the midst of whatever vile concept that they are spewing. Frank Lutz elaborated upon this technique with praise in his 2007 book . Lying does not deserve praise. It deserves rebuke. Let us spend a little more time, though, on the significance of distraction. The Significance Of Distraction Maria Montessori (1870-1952) writing in demonstrates the need for a child to be left alone to focus. It is one of the main conflicts between the adult world and the child world ‚Äî an inability for an adult to leave the child alone to focus. Instead, there is commonly a goal to push the child to comply with the adult‚Äôs hectic schedule or any adult schedule. Schedules are not all bad, but sometimes schedules provide more distraction from what is really important than they provide benefit. Montessori argues, that for a child to learn to the best of his ability, a child needs not a busy schedule of being shuttled to and fro at the whim of some external force, but that child instead needs a massive amount of peace and quiet. It is possible that this constant distraction is not only harmful for the child but may be harmful for the adult as well. We are all benefitted by the discipline that comes from saying ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù to the outside world more and allowing oneself to slow down and to focus on that which matters most. Wearing a mask has been described by many children as ‚Äúdistracting.‚Äù A mask distracts a child from more meaningful pursuits and keeps a child obsessed with the carnal discomfort that youthful bodies seldom know. If you can keep a child distracted from birth onward, that child never finds the focus to figure out core truths in life. The more that can be done, the less that child is able to find those core truths. If you can continue that distraction into the adult years ‚Äî the preventing of a person from meditating on a truth ‚Äî then that person has never had a chance to get to know truth and to encounter important revelations. One may meditate on a truth. One may alternately engage in the mind clearing nature of yoga, also called meditation, but in fact the opposite. That the meditation on a truth and the mind-clearing ‚Äúmeditation‚Äù about nothing go by the same name does not make them the same activity. Yoga ‚Äî A Fitting Religion For Our Time Yoga is a fitting religion for our time in which constant noise is dedicated to distracting a person from focusing on what matters, distracting one from meditating on truth. Then, exhausted by daily life, that individual finds refreshing calm in the yogic practice of clearing one‚Äôs mind and focussing on nothing. The net result is a day in which an individual has figured out how to spend an entire day focussed on nothing meaningful. Yoga helps many to bring calm to a life filled with motion, but which is generally absent a pursuit for anything meaningful. With yoga, one can be convinced that any disquiet in this situation is not due to the very foundations of the situation being rotten, but instead due to a lack of quiet meditation on nothing. With yoga, modernity then has another tool by which to say ‚ÄúBummed about life? Just spend more time meditating on nothing, and you‚Äôll feel great.‚Äù The calm such an approach to life offers can be so very alluring. A busy world can be well-served by more calm. The calm that serves the individual, though, is a calm that comes from a disciplined pursuit of what matters, rather than a calm that comes from a focus on nothingness. The calm comes from having real boundaries, not from having a life devoid of boundaries and then pretending an hour of savasana sets you right. It might temporarily calm you down, but it is not setting you right. Used in such a way, yoga is just another of the many drugs modernity uses to distract from the root of the problem. And Face Masks Are A Fitting Accoutrement Again, to ‚Äúpay attention‚Äù to nothing meaningful is to be distracted. To live day after day, week after week like this, is to build a practice of distraction and to live a life of distraction. Yoga makes the modern life of distraction tolerable, but is itself just really the same distraction. Face masks are the same fitting accoutrement for a society that says ‚ÄúHow can we get people to pay attention to distraction as much as possible?‚Äù This is to encourage frivolity in life, when seriousness about the gravity and value of life is what is really needed. Willingness or unwillingness to wear a mask has become the litmus test to seriousness on one hand and the entry pass to clown world on the other hand. No serious person has acquiesced through 2020 and beyond. One must be fundamentally frivolous to have done so. One must be fundamentally mistaken about the value of life to wear a face mask or to mask a child. That is to say, such a person is distracted or ‚Äúpays attention‚Äù to distraction. Though said to be built upon countless centuries of study on the importance of breath, yoga facilities and yoga practitioners, are almost exclusively so very willing to fully support mask policies. This behavior is telling. Words can be so vain. It is through action that one‚Äôs values are revealed. The good news is that anyone can turn over a new leaf any time he wants to. I invite you to disable the frivolous and to join me in that which matters, giving your life and the lives of those around you all the seriousness that such a realization entails. New York Times: Masks Groom Children To Accept That which They Intuitively Know To Be Uncomfortable And Wrong With the realization that billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, a pedophile and sex trafficker, and his partner Ghislaine Maxwell were friends and associates to hundreds and maybe thousands of the most powerful people on the planet, the word ‚Äúgrooming‚Äù has taken on a new meaning in popular usage. It is not to care fastidiously for one‚Äôs appearance, but to prepare a child for comfort in the presence of the vile. Though I am not grateful for the horrors that had to occur for me to recognize this practice and to have it thrust painfully in my face in the context of the few media sources that have spoken truthfully about the topic, I am grateful for the clarity. Observe below Danovitch encouraging the grooming of children. Danovitch writes: ‚ÄúKeeping a mask on over the course of a school day involves the kind of self-control and self-regulation that many children find challenging.‚Äù To lie to a child that a mask works to prevent the spread of a respiratory virus and then to guilt a child into doing that uncomfortable thing that the child inherently knows to be wrong is abuse. Some children are so abused that they even going so far as for the child to come to believe not their intuition as proper, but to instead believe the abuser as proper. Encouraging a child to exhibit self-control in the face of child abuse is called grooming. Some segments of our society encourage this. It aides the abuser. It allows abusers to do more abusing. Physical abuse is a gateway for sexual abuse. Sexual abuse is a gateway for physical abuse. No abuse is good abuse. Using a face mask, applied as Danovitch and her colleagues suggest, your child can come to love and respect their abuse and their abusers. All that need be done is to use a face mask according to public health protocols. New York Times: Masks Groom Children To Accept Abusive And Senseless Rules Grooming has a far more sinister meaning, but it is a term that can also be applied to the incrementalism around other boundary-encroaching behavior. Abusers, bullies, and all forms of sociopaths like to push and withdraw, push and withdraw, push and withdraw, until a person allows his boundaries to incrementally move far beyond where a person would have allowed those boundaries to move in one fell swoop. The degenerate knows the power of incremental degeneracy to change a person. That is part of grooming. Danovitch writes: ‚ÄúYounger children must inhibit the urge to pull off their mask, and older children must be mindful of when their mask is slipping down or when it‚Äôs OK to take it off.‚Äù If you want to raise a slave or a mindless cog in the system, this approach from Danovitch is a solid one. The Molechian degeneration of the face mask is, then, perfect for you and your family. You are also then a sicko. Next time someone asks about your faith practices, be honest and say, ‚ÄúI worship the Canaanite God Molech.‚Äù If you believe in good Judeo-Christian values of the individual made in the likeness of God, then this behavior of masking a child is about as sick as you can get. It grooms a child for things a child should never be groomed for. That is not your duty as a parent. Your duty is to put a fully functioning adult out into the world, capable of living life in a way that maximizes his special and unique gifts as fully as he can. Unless your child has an IQ of 43, you cannot raise that kind of adult and ‚Äúgroom‚Äù him to blindly obey authority. In the case of truly low functioning children, obedience is the best hope a parent has. That scenario however is an outlier, befitting a fraction of a percent of children. No healthy parent of a healthy child must want a child to say ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù to abusive or otherwise immoral authority. Children are to be taught to stand up to bad or misguided authority as early in life as possible, and to recognize and be able to say yes to good authority as early in life as possible. This is true even if that means standing against a parent in a moment in which the parent is caught in a state of hypocrisy. God made man in his likeness. Babies too. Though her and her disciples are imperfect, something that makes the Roman Catholic Maria Montessori, so special is her recognition and cogent argument that children too, long before adulthood, are made in the likeness of God. A practically pre-verbal 18-month-old exhibits amazing values and morality if allowed to express it, and an 18-year-old can be groomed into depressing it to the point of nihilistic degeneracy. Danovitch appears to recognize this distinction and to encourage the Molechian approach. For more on the Molechian approach, read through the plethora of Old Testament explanations of those children of Israel who went astray and worshipped Molech. Alternately, you can just read The New York Times or visit one of many mainstream churches, including the one I grew up in to learn to be a good follower of Molech. With the careful application of a face mask at the advice of Danovitch and her colleagues, you can help to groom your child to welcome the most vile behavior into his life as if it were not only normal but desirable. When used in line with public health protocols, face masks are a useful tool for exactly that. New York Times: Wearing A Mask Teaches Your Child To Be A Commie, A Bootlicker, A Denier Of The Scientific Method, And An Adherent To Scientism The scientific method is a process of hypothesizing, testing, sharing results, and retesting. It is really useful. It pays no regard to authority. It pays no regard to what is ‚Äúestablished.‚Äù It pays so little regard to authority that even a seven-year-old can use the scientific method to upend established science. It focuses on measuring and identifying what is true as best as possible. Scientism, in contrast, is devotion to that which you are told is the correct narrative from the correct authority. It is a perversion of the scientific method that resembles the scientific method in name alone. Because of its obedience to deceit, it is an approximate antonym of the scientific method, which tends to require an obedience to measurable truth. Danovitch writes: ‚ÄúPerhaps most important, wearing masks during a pandemic is an opportunity for even young children to practice caring for their community.‚Äù As if children going through school needed another influence from the school system to abandon their own pursuits and to subject themselves to the borg, the masks provide one more extremely useful tool for this. Mask wearing is not sacrifice for the good of others. Mask wearing is sacrifice of your sense of reason and decency at the altar of authority. This is called scientism. Those who practice scientism love to manipulatively throw around these words that work such as ‚Äúpandemic,‚Äù ‚Äúcaring,‚Äù and ‚Äúcommunity.‚Äù The ability to use such persuasive sounding words makes their sentiments no more true. It does, however, make their lies more difficult to spot. When one combines this manipulative practice with the theories of public health, one arrives at the sub-segment of public health called ‚Äúpublic health motivation theory.‚Äù Public health motivation theory is the study and practice of getting a patient or other individual to voluntarily forego informed consent and to be lulled into a state of acceptance by being presented with the right words, deceitfully used. Rudyard Kipling uncharitably described this behavior in a piece of writing from the 1890s, that predates public health motivation theory, but does not predate the behavior of twisting words in such a way that causes them to be used as their opposite, which again, is also known as lying. Kipling commented about this common human scenario: ‚Äúto hear the truth‚Ä¶twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools.‚Äù I do not consider all who fall for such lies to be fools, but that may only be out of ignorance for what the word ‚Äúfool‚Äù really means. Kipling lived in a time that generally demanded high standards of individuals. We live in a time that demands high standards of individuals who want to make it through this era without having their children‚Äôs minds rewired. With the aid of a face mask, diligently applied, according to the advice of Danovitch and her colleagues, you can teach your child to acquiesce to all the worst aspects of modern life and to exhibit those same awful aspects himself. Used according to public health protocols, face masks are an excellent tool for that. New York Times: Wearing A Face Mask Teaches A Child To Lie To Himself Wearing a mask teaches a child to lie to himself and to do so in the name of charity. This, thereby, enforces the acceptance of lies for the greater good, even if such a lie is good for no one. Danovitch writes: ‚ÄúDuring a time of anxiety and uncertainty, wearing a mask gives young children the ability to do something to help protect other people.‚Äù Sorry. Wearing a mask does not prevent the spread of a respiratory virus. At this point, there are at least 15 randomized controlled trials that say that. No legitimate studies prove otherwise. In fact, it has been theorized that wearing a face mask more likely increases the spread of disease. Such observations have been known for years, long before the Ides of March 2020 and were made very clearly in a May 2020 review paper from the CDC‚Äôs own peer reviewed journal of epidemiology Emerging Infectious Diseases, in a paper entitled ‚ÄúNonpharmaceutical Measures for Pandemic Influenza in Nonhealthcare Settings‚ÄîPersonal Protective and Environmental Measures.‚Äù Did critics of that paper call it irresponsible, since it may cause people to disobey face mask orders? Yes. Did that stop it from being true? No. A face mask order that accomplishes nothing of benefit for the wearer or for those around the wearer should be disregarded. Face masks are not just neutral for the wearer. They are harmful for the wearer. In fact, my next book Face Masks Hurt Kids is approximately 500 pages of information, including 40 pages of cited research on how harmful the face mask is both on the wearer AND those around the wearer. That is not just a reason to disregard the bad orders. It is a reason to imprison those who implemented and enforced the bad orders and to forever remove them from any position of public trust ever. With the help of Danovitch and her colleagues, you can use the mask to help teach your child the self-sabotaging personality flaw of lying to himself as effectively as possible. When used according to public health protocols, face masks are an excellent tool for that. Through in some smugness and some self-seriousness and you can really ‚Äúrewire‚Äù a previous child into a monster. New York Times: Mask Wearing Perverts The Very Concept Of Generosity Generosity is the giving of oneself for the benefit of others. Some people give when they feel like it. Sometimes they get frustrated when no one appreciates their giving. If you give a homeless man in Times Square (named for The New York Times) your half eaten 6 hour old reuben from Katz‚Äôs Deli (an amazing and massive sandwich if you have never tried one), it makes sense that he would not be too excited to receive it. In all honesty, it is not a very generous act. You are not going to eat it. You do not want to carry it anymore, and you feel more virtuous about handing it to the homeless man than throwing it in the garbage. However, you do not have the hard-earned sense of self-examination to recognize that you are merely treating a homeless man as a garbage can, a pigeon, or a rat, and then getting a buzz off the euphoria you receive by telling yourself that you have really acted in the spirit of Christmas. Not only is it dehumanizing of you, but it is perverse to then call such a thing generosity. If this comes after spending $368.95 to see a show, this behavior is perhaps even further questionable. Danovitch writes: ‚ÄúBy age 7, for example, children believe that it feels good to make sacrifices on behalf of others in need. Stressing that the discomfort and inconvenience of mask wearing are forms of generosity and public service might motivate children to address other social problems in their lives, like bullying.‚Äù Not only does she twist the concept of generosity, Danovitch‚Äôs version of public service is fascinating ‚Äî that which helps no one, but which you tell yourself is very helpful to them. That definition would explain a lot about the behavior of public servants through 2020 and beyond. It would also help to explain how the more disconnected a politician becomes, the more generous he convinces himself he is being. By ignoring the recipient of such largess, one makes it difficult to actually determine if such behavior is actually largess. Rape, theft, and slavery can also be deemed generous by the perpetrators of those crimes, I guess. Clear-minded individuals on that topic would beg to differ. Danovitch, having proverbially spent $368.95 on a Broadway ticket, does not understand why it is not very generous to give the proverbial homeless man the proverbial six-hour-old sandwich that is no longer fit for human consumption. With the targeted application of face masks policies, your child too can be so disconnected. When used strictly according to public health protocols, face masks are an excellent tool for that. Now What Are You Going To Do About It? Recognizing all of that, the question then becomes ‚Äî ‚ÄúHow do I stop wearing a mask?‚Äù You do not just need to stop wearing one mostly, or to start wearing one disobediently with your nose sticking out, or with pithy or derogatory phrases on the outside. You need to stop wearing one in each and every situation and to stop your children from ever being put in one. Resources Made Exactly For You & Others Like You Wrestling With This Topic I have written a book on this topic . In the first ten minutes of reading, it gives you everything you need to know about how to never wear a face mask again, yet still live a normal life. The book then spends the next 300 pages elaborating on that process in almost any situation you can think of. Making that purchase, or any purchase, through the Amazon link above allows a portion of the proceeds of that purchase to go to LewRockwell.com through a referral fee, which helps to fund the operation of this wonderful website. My LewRockwell.com writing also elaborates on how to never wear a mask again, and is available free of charge. Just start from around the time of the April 3, 2020, CDC announcement of the mask recommendation and work your way forward for a whole host of information on the topic. Also, I have a high quality set of trainings and videos that I send out to those who sign up for my email newsletter at www.RealStevo.com (http://www.RealStevo.com). These resources are meant to give you ways to maneuver through society unmasked and with the ease of a VIP. That is exactly what some people need help with. However, these videos are also meant to help provide an extra dose of courage, which is what I find most people really need a little extra encouragement with. If you or your loved ones are still wearing a face mask for any reason, I would like to invite you to avail yourself of these resources. No one should be wearing a mask. Face mask wearing is simply harmful to you and those around you. It is bad for you. It is especially bad for the sick. It is especially bad for the elderly. It is especially bad for children. That is what the best science of the last two years shows, and that is the direction that we must push the narrative around masks ‚Äî the direction of the truth. Masks harm you. The harm may even be irreversible. So, stop feeding into the lie by wearing one or by allowing one to be worn around you.",httpswwwlewrockwellcomallanstevothenewyorktimesexplainsthatmaskwearinghelpstorewirechildren pro tip google new

Everyone disliked homosexuals back in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. To the contrary, radical left movements were mostly pushed by minorities like Jews and homos as a vector for pursuing their own interests, including pushing feminism and social justice ideology. The last three points in pic related are explained by the fact that original communism came first and its adherents seized power the old fashioned way, that is, by force. ""American communism"" i.e. cultural Marxism (the Frankfurt School), is newer and the ideologues who developed its core concepts (Adorno, Gramsci, Horkheimer, etc.) were of the opinion that the original communism could not take root in Western countries and their strategy would instead be to reformulate Marxism such that it critiqued cultures/races/peoples and their institutions rather than critique classes (defined by wealth) and economic models. As such, a lot of concepts from original communism were transposed from class/economic issues over to racial/cultural issues, e.g. equity. This is to say that the racial tension and virtue signaling is baked into the ideology. It developed in the 30s-70s, so absorbed a lot of postmodernism, and was propagated in humanities departments across the US universities. Ultimately, the elites of today are in large part the students of those professors teaching cultural Marxist theory in the elite schools.

I'm a millenial as I'm 29 and I despise millenials.If we want to go by generational stereotypes, millenials are lazy, leftist, hipsters, who drink soy lattes and cancel people over twitter., Gen Z is super homosexual and transgender, etc.I'll take a boomer over my generation or gen z any day of the week. When they point out what ""boomers"" did in the 60s, they're basically talking about what hippies did, which 1) hippies were young at the time and young people are always idiots, but they were also a subset of that generation, not representative of all the boomers at the time and 2) that was a symptom of a culture that started to abandon God around that time, not the problem...the hippie marxist stuff was a symptom of us turning away from God.I really believe the whole boomer thing was a psy-op to get us to do what the left does, pointing the finger at a convenient target (in their case white people, in our case boomers)I remember when the boomer thing started and it's like it came out of thin air. The culture war was really starting to be won by Patriots, the tides were turning and most importantly, we were focused on the task, focused on the target (the cultural marxism everywhere)...and then suddenly, everyone started repeating ""ok boomer"" out of nowhere, and both the left and the right were doing it and our focus was diverted.When both the left and the right rally around a cultural talking point, you can be pretty sure you're being played.Take Pepe, the left hate pepe and call it a symbol of racism and whatnot, and pepe has been very effective for us, which is one way you know it's legitimate.Comparing that to the Karen memes which both the right and left use, there's a reason the left is ok with and just as frequently uses the ""Karen"" memes because it's a way to demonize suburban white women exclusively, when if a black woman behaved in the same way she's not called a Karen.Same with ""ok boomer"" the left is ok with it because it diverts the problem, gets people to look at a boogeyman rather than take personal responsibility.The left hates personal responsibility which is why they join hands with any meme that gets the right to create a boogeyman like the ""black community"" does. Because boogeymen destroy the movements/cultures that try and chase after them because those movements/cultures never end up cleaning up their own crap and instead focus on chasing that ever elusive and vague ""bad guy"". It's always ""the mans"" fault...but you can't ever fix ""the man"" but you can fix yourself.Even if boomers were the source of every problem we face (they're not, but just in a hypothetical), you could never do anything about that. The 60s are long gone, and it's like the black people forever obsessing about slavery. Neither black people nor us own a time machine so obsessing about a past event will only destroy you, rather than get you to fix yourself.",thank bob totally agree im millenial im despise millenialsif want go generational stereotypes millenials lazy leftist hipsters drink soy lattes cancel people twitter gen z super homosexual transgender etcill take boomer generation gen z day week point boomers theyre basically talking hippies hippies young time young people always idiots also subset generation representative boomers time symptom culture started abandon god around time problemthe hippie marxist stuff symptom us turning away godi really believe whole boomer thing psyop get us left pointing finger convenient target case white people case boomersi remember boomer thing started like came thin air culture war really starting patriots tides turning importantly focused task focused target cultural marxism everywhereand suddenly everyone started repeating ok boomer nowhere left right focus divertedwhen left right rally around cultural talking point pretty sure youre playedtake pepe left hate pepe call symbol racism whatnot pepe effective us one way know legitimatecomparing karen memes right left use theres reason left ok frequently uses karen memes way demonize suburban white women exclusively black woman behaved way shes called karensame ok boomer left ok diverts problem gets people look boogeyman rather take personal responsibilitythe left hates personal responsibility join hands meme gets right create boogeyman like black community boogeymen destroy movementscultures try chase movementscultures never end cleaning crap instead focus chasing ever elusive vague bad guy always mans faultbut cant ever fix man fix yourselfeven boomers source every problem face theyre hypothetical could never anything long gone like black people forever obsessing slavery neither black people us time machine obsessing past event destroy rather get fix,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

That kid is now doing great and that extra year was essential. It may be unusual but it‚Äôs not so statistically rare as to be ignored as a fluke.
 
 Your question about ‚Äúeducators‚Äù has several angles. Parents are more accountable for, and more exposed to the consequences of their child‚Äôs education than anyone else. Second only to the child, they have more skin in the game.
 
 Most parents are also taxpayers: everyone at the school is their employee. They have an absolute right to get into the details. That right is what comes with and is inseparable from making them pay for that service.
 
 The teachers may be experts in a subject (a contention needing proof) but they are less expert in that particular child than the parent. Thus the parents must be allowed to simply and easily do their job as an advocate for their child. The first job of an advocate is to understand the situation their charge will be going into. Meaning: an ability to review material BEFORE that material is presented.
 
 To anyone not already indoctrinated in whatever you want to call the latest moral panic (woke, crt, cultural Marxism), it‚Äôs blindingly obvious that our public universities and schools are aggressively moving in the direction of indoctrinating children into a psychology damaging religion-like fiction.

In some areas, the tranny stuff and certain theorists, it was enlightening as I am not well versed on those matters as much as I should, but on others, he was lacking.

It lacks the content to justify the scope. It should be on Cultural Marxism and a few appendixes on other matters (his diversions into Nietzsche, Jung, Lasch, ""white privilege""- the best section in the book btw-) It's worth buying but it was not what I wanted. But if you are going to buy one by him, take this over Psychotic Left or his other works on the matter. This is the best of his on the topic. And the cover is great. His view on Stalin is, uh, interesting. I'd recommend Artists on the Right, but I do not want people giving money to Counter Currents. Stick with the free, shorter essays online. E Michael Jones is like this as well. His book, Monsters From The ID is great in sections where Jones cares what he is writing about but he wants a unifying vision. And his inane ramblings about the illuminati distract from a pretty interesting theory on horror. The link between it and sex isn't totally new but the way he takes and the way he writes on it is worth it. Very eye opening. You learn a lot from it. I have my issues with Jones (I do not bother with much of his political work or online debates) but his cultural stuff is engaging. And it has an index.

So that's two recommendations. Pick it up. It's well-written and has interesting details. I think, with regards to your argument of traits being ""lost"", it's not so much that as it is the society changes so that such traits are no longer of use. How many loners do we have today who just want to be left alone to focus on their one thing? Used to be those young White men could be inventors or artists or explorers. But nowadays we're undereducated, there are few schools for real art, and everything's been explored. And even if that weren't true, we're drained of motivation by a society set up to belittle and discourage us. Consider that most of our ancestors were farmers and yet small scale farming is virtually impossible these days outside of an expensive hobby. It's in our blood but how can we do it? So there's a general malaise as a result of the industrial revolution, tech revolution, and cultural marxism. Regression to the mean isn't as ""conclusive"" as you might think because there's an awful lot of mean. Western civilization has incredible diversity of roles when it's functioning well. A thriving middle class basically means everyone with motivation can pursue their own interests, leading to a diverse economy that deals in a wide range of products.

 American Nations is very good, but aside from it being pop history and not academic (though very useful in how he gives a map at the county level of ""nations,"" I've even used it in statistical research) the guy's analysis (which is basically just a summary of the regional cultures and then a basic review of American history using the gimmick of referring to things by their ""nation"" as a way to reinforce his point) becomes increasingly deranged as he gets closer to the present-day until it completely falls apart into libtard ranting and raving. I see this happen a lot with historians, they can be perfectly reasonable about events before 1900 but as soon as it becomes something within living memory their opinions become completely worthless.
